  abstract = {We present a novel distributed algorithm for convex constrained optimization problems that are subject to noise corruption and uncertainties. The proposed scheme can be classified as a distributed stochastic approximation method, where a unique feature here is that we allow for multiple noise terms to appear in both the computation and communication stages of the distributed iterative process. Specifically, we consider problems that involve multiple agents optimizing a separable convex objective function subject to convex local constraints and linear coupling constraints. This is a richer class of problems compared to those that can be handled by existing distributed stochastic approximation methods which consider only consensus constraints and fewer sources of noise. The proposed algorithm utilizes the augmented Lagrangian (AL) framework, which has been widely used recently to solve deterministic optimization problems in a distributed way. We show that the proposed method generates sequences of primal and dual variables that converge to their respective optimal sets almost surely.},

In most of the existing fault estimation approaches, the observer matching condition should be satisfied. However, this condition is hard to meet for many systems. To overcome this restriction, a new fault estimation method is proposed, where an intermediate variable is introduced and a specially designed intermediate estimator is proposed to estimate the state and the faults simultaneously by exploiting the properties of fault distribution matrix. It is proved that the states of the error system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation examples verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This technical note focuses on adaptive dynamic surface control for a class of strict-feedback nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties, where a novel technique coined composite learning is developed to guarantee parameter convergence without the PE condition. In the composite learning, online recorded data together with instantaneous data are applied to generate prediction errors, and both tracking errors and prediction errors are utilized to update parametric estimates. The proposed approach is also extended to an output-feedback case by using a nonlinear separation principle. The distinctive feature of the composite learning is that parameter convergence can be guaranteed by an interval-excitation condition which is much weaker than the PE condition such that the control performance can be improved from practical asymptotic stability to practical exponential stability. An illustrative example is used for verifying effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Past approaches, which consider scheduling sensors through deterministic event-triggers, reduce communication and maintain estimation quality.

  abstract = {Abstract This paper considers a remote state estimation problem, where a sensor measures the state of a linear discrete-time system. The sensor has computational capability to implement a local Kalman filter. The sensor-to-estimator communications are scheduled intentionally over a finite time horizon to obtain a desirable tradeoff between the state estimation quality and the limited communication resources. Compared with the literature, we adopt a Gaussianity-preserving event-based sensor schedule bypassing the nonlinearity problem met in threshold event-based polices. We derive the closed-form of minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator and show that, if communication is triggered, the estimator cannot do better than the local Kalman filter, otherwise, the associated error covariance, is simply a sum of the estimation error of the local Kalman filter and the performance loss due to the absence of communication. We further design the scheduler’s parameters by solving a dynamic programming (DP) problem. The computational overhead of the \{DP\} problem is less sensitive to the system dimension compared with that of existing algorithms in the literature.},

The hybrid modification results in suitable jumps of the observer state, which therefore corresponds to a discontinuous function of ordinary time. The jump conditions depend on the plant output and on extra states incorporated in the observer that evolve according to some suitable combination of the output error and of its integral. Our result is illustrated on a well known case study taken from the literature, and also on a planar robot with rigid links. },

Suppose each agent updates its own state using a weighted sum of its neighbor's relative states with possibly negative weights. Then the affine control problem can be solved for either undirected or directed interaction graphs. It is shown in this paper that an affine formation is stabilizable over an undirected graph if and only if the undirected graph is universally rigid, while an affine formation is stabilizable over a directed graph in the  d -dimensional space if and only if the directed graph is  (d + 1) -rooted. Rigorous analysis is provided, mainly relying on Laplacian associated with the interaction graph, which contain both positive and negative weights.},

In particular, networks of identical passive subsystems, which are coupled according to a tree topology, are considered. For such networked systems, reduction is performed by clustering subsystems that show similar behavior and subsequently aggregating their states, leading to a reduced-order networked system that allows for an insightful physical interpretation. The clusters are chosen on the basis of the analysis of controllability and observability properties of associated edge systems, representing the importance of the couplings and providing a measure of the similarity of the behavior of neighboring subsystems. This reduction procedure is shown to preserve synchronization properties (i.e., the convergence of the subsystem trajectories to each other) and allows for the a priori computation of a bound on the reduction error with respect to external inputs and outputs. The method is illustrated by means of an example of a thermal model of a building.},

In this technical note, we prove the converse. We thereby show that the only decentralized control problems for which the set of Youla–Kucera parameters is convex are those which are quadratically invariant. We further show that under additional assumptions, quadratic invariance is necessary and sufficient for the set of achievable closed-loop maps to be convex. We give two versions of our results. The first applies to bounded linear operators on a Banach space and the second applies to (possibly unstable) causal LTI systems in discrete or continuous time.},

For the static output-feedback continuous event-trigger may generate an infinite number of sampling instants in finite time (Zeno phenomenon) what makes it inapplicable to the real-world systems. Periodic event-trigger avoids this behavior but does not use all the available information. In the present paper we aim to exploit the advantage of the continuous-time measurements and guarantee a positive lower bound on the inter-event times by introducing a switching approach for finding a waiting time in the event-triggered mechanism. Namely, our idea is to present the closed-loop system as a switching between the system under periodic sampling and the one under continuous event-trigger and take the maximum sampling preserving the stability as the waiting time. We extend this idea to the  L_{2} -gain and ISS analysis of perturbed networked control systems with network-induced delays. By examples we demonstrate that the switching approach to event-triggered control can essentially reduce the amount of measurements to be sent through a communication network compared to the existing methods.},

We try to continue this line of research and provide explicit worst-case lower bound. Then we exhibit large deviation effects for other pole locations and estimate lower bounds for them. The upper bounds for deviations of trajectories are much better studied; to obtain the smallest deviations by static linear feedback the techniques of linear matrix inequalities can be exploited. We demonstrate that for such closed-loop systems the upper and lower bounds have the same asymptotic behavior. },

For the class of optimal formation problems where the objective is to maximize coverage, we show that the optimal formation is a tree which can be efficiently constructed without solving a MINLP. In a mission space constrained by obstacles, we separate the formation process into intervals with no obstacles detected and intervals where one or more obstacles are detected. In the latter case, we propose a minimum-effort reconfiguration approach for the formation which still optimizes the objective function while avoiding the obstacles and ensuring connectivity.

In these control schemes all the agents use a model of their neighbourhood in order to generate triggering instants in which the local controller is updated and, if needed, local information based on the adopted control input is broadcasted to neighbouring agents. Synchronization of the network is proved and the existence of Zeno behaviour is excluded; an event-triggered strategy able to guarantee the existence of a minimum lower bound between inter-event times for broadcasted information and for control signal updating is proposed, thus allowing applications where both the communication bandwidth and the maximum updating frequency of actuators are critical. This idea is further extended in an asynchronous periodic event-triggered schemes where the agents check a trigger condition via a periodic distributed communication without requiring a model based computation. },

  abstract = {Abstract The comparison between time-varying hybrid trajectories is crucial for tracking, observer design and synchronisation problems for hybrid systems with state-triggered jumps. In this paper, a generic distance function is designed that can be used for this purpose. The so-called “peaking phenomenon”, which occurs when using the Euclidean distance to compare two hybrid trajectories, is circumvented by taking the hybrid nature of the system explicitly into account. Based on the proposed distance function, we define the stability of a trajectory and present sufficient Lyapunov-type conditions for hybrid system with state-triggered jumps. A constructive Lyapunov function design is presented for hybrid systems with affine flow and jump maps and a jump set that is a hyperplane. The stability conditions can then be verified using linear matrix conditions. Finally, for this class of systems, we present a tracking controller that asymptotically stabilises a given hybrid reference trajectory and we illustrate our results with an example.},

The undesirable effects of packet dropouts and scheduling, such as instability or deteriorated performance, are addressed by application of a protocol and controller co-design method. The used method exploits Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework and the flexible \{NCS\} architecture which allows for distributed computation. Uniform Global Asymptotic Stability (UGAS) is established by assuming a finite bound on the number of consecutive packet dropouts and appropriate modifications to often adopted \{MPC\} stability-related assumptions. Two approaches that demonstrate \{UGAS\} are provided. The proof of one approach consists of finding an appropriate Lyapunov candidate function, while the other uses a cascade stability idea.},

Under suitable assumptions, a state feedback control law with state-dependent switching is designed by using the convex combination method and the adding a power integrator technique.

In particular, given known bounds on disturbance torques and uncertainties in the spacecraft inertia matrix, non-conservative ultimate bounds were obtained for the attitude tracking error assuming that the attitude and angular velocity are measured with known bounds on the measurement errors. In this paper, these results are extended to the case where the attitude and angular velocity are not measured, but estimated using an observer. Specifically, it is shown that given any attitude and angular velocity observer with known ultimate bounds on the estimation errors, the previously developed expressions for the ultimate bounds on the tracking error remain valid with observer-based control, provided the ultimate bounds on the estimation errors are used in place of the previously fixed bounds on the measurement errors. A numerical example of attitude tracking using a gyro and a single vector measurement demonstrates the utility of the proposed technique.},

The proposed ASMC uses a new adaptive law to achieve good tracking performance with small chattering effect. The new adaptive law considers an arbitrarily small vicinity of the sliding manifold, in which the derivatives of the adaptive gains are inversely proportional to the sliding variables. Such an adaptive law provides remarkably fast adaptation and chattering reduction near the sliding manifold. To yield the desirable closed-loop poles and simplify a complicated system model by adapting feedback compensation, the proposed ASMC scheme works together with a pole-placement control (PPC) and a TDE technique. It is shown that the tracking errors of the proposed ASMC scheme are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) with arbitrarily small bound. The practical effectiveness and the fast adaptation of the proposed ASMC are illustrated in simulations and experiments with robot manipulators, and compared with those of an existing ASMC.},

To distributively achieve the synchronization condition by updating local controller parameters, two broadcast mechanisms are presented on a spanning tree (for undirected graphs) and a cycle containing all nodes (for directed graphs). To ensure the tolerance to disconnections, the proposed broadcast mechanisms are redesigned by adding redundant information flows on spanning trees (for undirected graphs) and cycles containing all nodes (for directed graphs).},

  abstract  = {It is proposed to estimate wind velocity, Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) and Sideslip Angle (SSA) of a fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using only kinematic relationships with a Kalman Filter (KF), avoiding the need to know aerodynamic models or other aircraft parameters. Assuming that measurements of airspeed and attitude of an UAV are available as inputs, a linear 4th order time-varying model of the UAV's longitudinal speed and the 3-D wind velocity is used to design a Kalman-filter driven by a GNSS velocity measurement airspeed sensor. An observability analysis shows that the states can be estimated along with an airspeed sensor calibration factor provided that the flight maneuvers are persistently exciting, i.e. the aircraft changes attitude. The theoretical analysis of the KF shows that global exponential stability of the estimation error is achieved under these conditions. The method is tested using experimental data from three different UAVs, using their legacy autopilot to provide basic estimates of UAV velocity and attitude. The results show that convergent estimates are achieved with typical flight patterns indicating that excitation resulting from the environment and normal flight operation is sufficient. Wind velocity estimates correlate well with observed winds at the ground. The validation of AOA and SSA estimates is preliminary, but indicate some degree of correlation between the AOA estimate and vertical accelerometer measurements, as would be expected since lift force can be modeled as a linear function of AOA in normal flight.},

To identify the unknown inertial matrix included in the attitude dynamic model, this paper proposes a new structural identifier that differs from those previously proposed in that it additionally contains a neural networks (NNs) mechanism and a robust adaptive mechanism, respectively. Using the NNs to compensate the unknown aerodynamic forces online and the robust adaptive mechanism to cancel the combination of the overlarge NNs compensation error and the external disturbances, the new robust neural identifier exhibits a better identification performance in the complex flight environment. Moreover, an optimized algorithm is included in the NNs mechanism to alleviate the burdensome online computation. By the strict Lyapunov argument, the asymptotic convergence of the inertial matrix identification error, position tracking error, and attitude tracking error to arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin is proved. The simulation and implementation results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller.},

Firstly, an intermediate control law is designed by a modified adaptive backstepping design procedure, where a damping term with the estimate of unknown bounds and a positive time-varying integral function are introduced in the intermediate control law. Then, a novel smooth function is introduced in the control law to eliminate the effect of quantization based on the intermediate control law constructed in the first step. It is shown that all the closed-loop signals are bounded and the output tracking error converges to zero asymptotically in spite of input quantization, disturbances and possibly infinite number of faults.

  abstract = {Air motors are increasingly being used in pneumatic related industries because of their advantages of low operating cost and low maintenance. The \{DSP\} controller and the backstepping sliding mode control method were utilized in this study to control an X – Y pneumatic table for tracking trajectory. Due to the effects of the compressibility of air, friction between the motor and ball screw table and the dead-zone effect caused by the proportional valve, the system will yield different responses even with the same inlet pressure and will chatter at low speed. Hence under certain conditions, this method of backstepping sliding mode control can be applied to achieve better results than with the \{PID\} controller, such as for tracking circle error and tracking error of the two axes. According to the results, a steady-state error of 0.5 μm can be achieved. The proposed method of backstepping sliding mode control can accomplish accurate tracking circle trajectory performance, offering an improvement in the tracking error of more than 50% over that of the \{PID\} controller. },

Then, a simple sigmoid neural network is employed to approximate the uncertain parts including saturation in the system. By combing the backstepping technique and the sliding-mode control, virtual controls are designed in each step.

To guarantee the optimality of the Kalman filter, the noise covariances need to be exactly known. However, this is not necessarily true in many practical applications. Usually, they are either completely unknown or at most partially known. In this technical note, we study performance of the Kalman filter with mismatched process and measurement noise covariances. For this purpose, three mean squared errors (MSEs) are used, namely the ideal MSE (IMSE), the filter calculated MSE (FMSE), and the true MSE (TMSE). The main contribution of this work is that the relationships between the three MSEs are disclosed from two points of views. The first view is about their ordering and the second view is about the relative closeness from the FMSE and TMSE to the IMSE. Using the first view, it is found that for the case with positive (definite) deviation from the truth, the FMSE is the worst and the IMSE is the best. And for the case with negative (definite) deviation, the TMSE is the worst and the best is the FMSE. Using the second view, it is found that the TMSE is relatively closer to the IMSE than the FMSE if the deviation is larger than certain threshold, and the TMSE will be farther away otherwise. Numerical examples further verify these conclusions.},

The first one is a linear descriptor reduced-order observer, which generates the exact estimation of state and sensor faults together with disturbances by decoupling them from the state vector without any supplementary design. The second one refers to a descriptor sliding mode observer approach, where the state, disturbances, sensor and actuator faults can be reconstructed simultaneously. In the second method, the reachability of sliding surface is not necessary to be investigated, since the actuator faults can be estimated directly without using the equivalent output error injection scheme as in traditional sliding mode observers. Therefore, both developed observer approaches avoid the sliding surface switching problem of traditional sliding mode observers in application to switched systems. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the two designed observer methods. },

It is often hard to find the global solution of this optimization problem because in most cases both the corresponding objective function and the search space are nonconvex. The difficulty in solving the optimization problem depends mainly on the experimental conditions, more specifically on the spectra of the input/output data collected from the system. It is therefore possible to improve the convergence of the algorithms by properly choosing the data prefilters; in this paper we show how to perform this choice. We present the application of the proposed approach to case studies where the standard algorithms tend to fail to converge to the global minimum. },

  abstract = {Abstract This paper studies switching stabilization problems for general switched nonlinear systems. A piecewise smooth control-Lyapunov function (PSCLF) approach is proposed and a constructive way to design stabilizing switching laws is developed. The switching law is constructed via directional derivative of the \{PSCLF\} with a careful discussion on various technical issues that may occur on the nonsmooth surface. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure stability of closed-loop Filippov solutions including possible sliding motions. The proposed \{PSCLF\} approach provides a unified framework to study switching stabilization problems with a systematic consideration of sliding motions. Application to stabilization of switched nonlinear systems is illustrated through a numerical example. },

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, the state estimation problem for discrete-time Markov jump linear systems affected by time-correlated measurement noise is considered where the time-correlated measurement noise is described by a linear system model with white noise. As a result, two algorithms are proposed to estimate the state of the system under consideration based on a measurement sequence. The first algorithm is optimal in the sense of minimum mean-square error, which is obtained based on the measurement differencing method, Bayes’ rule and some results derived in this paper. The second algorithm is a suboptimal algorithm obtained by using a lot of Gaussian hypotheses. The proposed suboptimal algorithm is finite-dimensionally computable and does not increase computational and storage load with time. Computer simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed suboptimal algorithm. },

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, the regularity and stability analysis of discrete-time Markov jump linear singular systems (MJLSS) is performed. When dealing with singular systems, a primary concern is related to the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the system. This problem, that is called regularity problem, has a known solution when the linear singular system is not subject to jumps (LSS). It turns out that when the pair of matrices that describes the dynamics of the \{LSS\} satisfies a certain condition, then it is regular. By extending this condition to MJLSS, a unique solution for this class of systems is derived. Indeed through the idea of mode-to-mode regularity, which is stronger than the mode-by-mode notion that can be found in the literature, the existence of a unique solution of an \{MJLSS\} is shown. Furthermore, for systems that are mode-to-mode regular, it is shown how to obtain recursive second moment models whose complexity depends on how anticipative the systems is. The derived results on regularity and second moment modeling enable us to study stability of an MJLSS. By following the literature on Markov jump linear systems (MJLS), four different concepts of stability are introduced and their relationship is established. The results presented in this paper generalize well known results concerning the stability given in the \{MJLS\} theory. For instance, it is shown that the stability of the system is equivalent to the spectral radius of an augmented matrix being less than one, as happens in the theory of MJLS. },

  abstract = {Abstract This paper investigates the path following control problem for an unmanned airship in the presence of unknown wind and uncertainties. The backstepping technique augmented by a robust adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is employed as the main control framework. Based on the horizontal dynamic model of the airship, an improved adaptive integral line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law is first proposed, which suits any parametric paths. The guidance law calculates the desired yaw angle and estimates the wind. Then the controller is extended to cope with the airship yaw tracking and velocity control by resorting to the augmented backstepping technique. The uncertainties of the dynamics are compensated by using the robust RBFNNs. Each robust \{RBFNN\} utilizes an nth-order smooth switching function to combine a conventional \{RBFNN\} with a robust control. The conventional \{RBFNN\} dominates in the neural active region, while the robust control retrieves the transient outside the active region, so that the stability range can be widened. Stability analysis shows that the controlled closed-loop system is globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach. },

The primary objective of the allocation is to minimize torque error and improve performance when the system saturates or becomes singular. As a secondary objective, internal bearing and gear friction are exploited to reduce power usage without the need for accurate friction models. The algorithm exploits the fact that redundant control moment gyroscopes (CMGs) and the rotors of reaction wheel assemblies (RWAs) have nonsingleton minimum torque error solutions. Thus, friction in the rotors and gimbals of the CMG and RWA can be used to find a minimum power solution among the set of minimum torque error solutions. The convex optimization framework enables real-time implementable algorithms, which fully utilize control authority without requiring tuning for changes in the number or the configuration of actuators.},

  abstract  = {Blimps are a promising platform for aerial robotics and have been studied extensively for this purpose. Unlike other aerial vehicles, blimps are relatively safe and also possess the ability to loiter for long periods. These advantages, however, have been difficult to exploit because blimp dynamics are complex and inherently non-linear. The classical approach to system modeling represents the system as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based on Newtonian principles. A more recent modeling approach is based on representing state transitions as a Gaussian process (GP). In this paper, we present a general technique for system identification that combines these two modeling approaches into a single formulation. This is done by training a Gaussian process on the residual between the non-linear model and ground truth training data. The result is a GP-enhanced model that provides an estimate of uncertainty in addition to giving better state predictions than either ODE or GP alone. We show how the GP-enhanced model can be used in conjunction with reinforcement learning to generate a blimp controller that is superior to those learned with ODE or GP models alone.},

    abstract = { Purpose – In recent years, high‐altitude/long‐endurance airship platforms have generated great interest as a means to provide communications and surveillance capabilities. The purpose of this paper is to develop a model for airship conceptual design and help provide insight into the viability of high‐altitude/long‐endurance airships.Design/methodology/approach – A configuration analysis model with the consideration of pressure difference, temperature difference, and helium purity, etc. was developed. The influences of the airship payload, size and area required of solar cell with environment and operation parameters, such as operation latitude, pressure difference, temperature difference, helium purity, seasons, latitude, and wind speed, etc. were analyzed.Findings – The results show that the area of solar cell required for stratospheric airship is very large under the condition of low altitude, high latitude, wind, and in winter, etc. which might make the design of high‐altitude/long‐endurance airship an elusive goal. They also show that the solar cell efficiency is the key technology in the control of solar cell area required for airships, and the technology advances in regenerative fuel cells and propeller efficiency have significant effects among on the airship payload, size, and solar cell area required for airship.Originality/value – The paper analyses the energy balance of the high‐altitude/long‐endurance airship. }

  abstract = {The data-driven H∞ control problem of nonlinear distributed parameter systems is considered in this paper. An off-policy learning method is developed to learn the H∞ control policy from real system data rather than the mathematical model. First, Karhunen-Loève decomposition is used to compute the empirical eigenfunctions, which are then employed to derive a reduced-order model (ROM) of slow subsystem based on the singular perturbation theory. The H∞ control problem is reformulated based on the ROM, which can be transformed to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation, theoretically. To learn the solution of the HJI equation from real system data, a data-driven off-policy learning approach is proposed based on the simultaneous policy update algorithm and its convergence is proved. For implementation purpose, a neural network (NN)- based action-critic structure is developed, where a critic NN and two action NNs are employed to approximate the value function, control, and disturbance policies, respectively. Subsequently, a least-square NN weight-tuning rule is derived with the method of weighted residuals. Finally, the developed data-driven off-policy learning approach is applied to a nonlinear diffusion-reaction process, and the obtained results demonstrate its effectiveness.},

The shape of the envelope has a major influence on the lift and drag efficiency of an airship. Furthermore, the efficiency of a conventional actuator, such as an aerodynamic control surface for stratospheric platforms, is decreased by the low-atmospheric density and flight speed. Thus, a new type of effector configuration must be proposed. A new multivectored thrust airship called flat peach is proposed in this paper. The name is attributed to the shape of the airship, which resembles a flat peach that is a cross between a ball and a water droplet. Thus, this airship has a smaller drag coefficient than the spherical airship and higher lift efficiency than a conventional airship. A control allocation strategy among the multivectored thrusters is proposed, and a composite control structure is designed for the airship to realize accurate position control and to decrease energy consumption. },

Firstly, an adaptive method of discretizing airship state space is proposed after analyzing its motions, through which the MDP(Markov Decision Process) model of control is established on the foundation of actual motions. Then, to save computing time and avoid being trapped in “curse of dimensionality”, data of actual actions online is collected as reference for virtual actions, and control input is worked out by learning from virtual actions offline. Finally, simulations of stratospheric airship's common tasks like hovering and path tracking are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control strategy. Results show that the control strategy works well without access to airship accurate dynamic model. The algorithm's computational efficiency and convergence can meet requirements of practical application, and the precision makes it suitable for tasks like reconnaissance and communication. Control results get better in limited constant wind than windless conditions.},

These flying objects lighter than air (L.T.A.) are assumed to undergo large rigid-body motion and small elastic deformation. The formalism used is based on the Euler--Lagrange approach. The airship considered in this study is represented by a flexible ellipsoid of revolution. The coupling between the added masses issued from the overall body motion and those issued from the elasticity was determined by means of the velocity potential flow theory. We develop a fully analytical methodology with some assumptions. This feature distinguishes the current work from earlier treatments of the coupling, it allows one to minimise the number of degrees of freedom of the dynamical model, and renders the model suitable for use in the algorithms of stabilisation and trajectory generation. Numerical simulations are presented at the end of this paper. They underline the interest of the developed theoretical results.},

  abstract = {The aeroelastic derivatives for today's aircraft are calculated in the concept phase using a standard procedure. This scheme has to be extended for large airships, due to various nonlinearities in structural and aerodynamic behaviour. In general, the structural model of an airship is physically as well as geometrically nonlinear. The main sources of nonlinearity are large deformations and the nonlinear material behaviour of membranes. The aerodynamic solution is also included in the nonlinear problem, because the deformed airship influences the surrounding flow. Due to these nonlinearities, the aeroelastic problem for airships can only be solved by an iterative procedure. As one possibility, the coupled aerodynamic and structural dynamic problem was handled using linked standard solvers. On the structural side, the Finite-Element program package \{ABAQUS\} was extended with an interface to the aerodynamic solver VSAERO. \{VSAERO\} is based on the aerodynamic panel method using potential flow theory. The equilibrium of the internal structural and the external aerodynamic forces leads to the structural response and a trimmed flight state for the specified flight conditions (e.g. speed, altitude). The application of small perturbations around a trimmed state produces reaction forces and moments. These constraint forces are then transferred into translational and rotational acceleration fields by performing an inertia relief analysis of the disturbed structural model. The change between the trimmed flight state and the disturbed one yields the respective aeroelastic derivatives. By including the calculated derivatives in the linearised equation of motion system, it is possible to judge the stability and controllability of the investigated airship. },

  abstract = {In recent years, the study of semi-rigid airship has revived with the development of airships. Semi-rigid airships have some characteristics of rigid airships and non-rigid airships. Due to the flexibility of the envelope of the non-rigid airship, the variation of the temperature of the inner gas will lead to its structure deformation and affect its flight altitude. This paper develops the structural mechanics model, thermodynamic model and dynamic model of the semi-rigid airship, based on which nonlinear finite element analysis is employed for geometrically nonlinear deformation of the airship upper film in consideration of thermodynamics and structural mechanics coupling. Based on the thermal-structural interaction, the thermal characteristics and flight performances of the airship during floating flight are investigated. The 3-D solar radiation and temperature distribution of the airship skin and the temperature variation of the inner gas are presented to investigate the thermal performance of the airship, flight velocity, acceleration and flight altitude are simulated to investigate the flight performance, and the variations of the volume and pressure difference of the inner gas are calculated to provide a basis for structure design. The results of the simulation can be referenced for the design of the semi-rigid airship, and can be used for the further study on the attitude control of the airship during its floating flight. },

  abstract = {Numerical investigation was conducted on an airship of hull-fin configuration for aerodynamic and aeroelastic characteristics in three-dimensional viscous flows. The mathematical model was built and the corresponding numerical code was developed for the fluid-structure interaction problem. The governing equations of the viscous flow with LL-Low Reynolds modified model were solved by the standard \{SIMPLE\} algorithm based on the finite volume method. A fluid-structure coupled method was employed to solve the nonlinear aeroelasticity problem for the airship. The computational results of the viscous flow are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. The simulation on the aeroelastic behavior of the airship in a trimmed flight reveals the effect of structure flexibility on the aerodynamic performance. },

Due to the motion disturbances in the environment (currents), these tasks are important to keep the vehicle stabilized relative to an external reference frame. The main difficulties to achieve station keeping and docking are related to the nonholonomic constraints of the blimp moving in 3D, having a limited number of controllable degrees of freedom. The relative position of the vehicle with respect to a docking station is tracked using vision. A planar surface is chosen as a reference plane which allows visual tracking of an environmental region, based on planar projective transformations. An image-based control law is proposed together with a dynamic model for the vehicle. Experiments and results are described and discussed},

A flight decomposition allowing one to define canonical navigation phases from take-off to landing is proposed. For each phase a reduced model is determined and a controller is designed on the base of backstepping techniques. This approach allows one to consider the kinematic and dynamic requirement separately. Due to the decoupling properties, an equilibrium state is reached at the end of each flight phase, allowing one to model easily the transition between them. Simulations of the different controllers are presented for a realistic model of blimp including aerostatic, dynamic and aerodynamic effects.},

abstract={This paper considers the design of a novel closed- loop trajectory tracking controller for an underactuated robotic airship having 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) and 3 controls, on forward, yaw and pitch motions using two side thrusters. A backstepping methodology is adopted as a design tool, since it is suitable for the cascaded nature of the vehicle dynamics. It also offers design flexibility and robustness against parametric uncertainties which are often encountered in aerodynamic modeling and air stream disturbances. Indeed, in our simulations we assume a 10% error in all dynamic parameters and yet the controller performs position, orientation, linear and angular velocities tracking successfully. We also impose an additional air stream disturbance and the controller corrects the vehicle's trajectory successfully too.},

The orbital uncertainty is described as the model uncertainty, and the possible thruster faults are modelled by scaling factors. By introducing a state-feedback controller, the autonomous rendezvous problem is regarded as an asymptotic stabilization problem of a switching system composed of impulse action phase and free motion phase. Based on Lyapunov theory and genetic algorithms (GA), a reliable impulsive controller design approach is proposed. With the obtained controller, the autonomous spacecraft rendezvous is accomplished by a series of proper impulse thrust in spite of the orbital uncertainty and the possible thruster faults.

Generally, the number of thrusters in an \{AUV\} is more than what is minimally required to produce the desired motion. We investigate how to exploit the excess number of thrusters to accommodate thruster faults during operation. First, a redundancy resolution scheme is presented that takes into account the presence of excess number of thrusters along with any thruster faults and determines the reference thruster forces to produce the desired motion. These reference thruster forces are utilized in the controller to generate the required motion. This approach resolves the thruster redundancy in the Cartesian space and allows the \{AUV\} to track the task-space trajectories with asymptotic reduction of the task-space errors. Results from computer simulations are presented to demonstrate the viability of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={This technical note proposes a robust iterative learning control (ILC) strategy to regulate iteratively-operated, finite-duration nonrepetitive systems characterized by iteration-varying uncertainties in initial states, external disturbances, plant model matrices and desired reference trajectories. Our convergence analysis exploits results on input-to-state stability of discrete parameterized systems. For a class of multiple-input, multiple-output discrete-time linear systems, with all iteration-varying uncertainties bounded, we give one condition that ensures boundedness of all system trajectories and an additional, second condition that ensures convergence of tracking error. Notably, we do not require the standard ILC contraction mapping requirement to hold at each iteration. Moreover, we show that it is possible to achieve perfect output tracking if the iteration-varying uncertainties all converge with increasing iteration.},

However, the general PF always suffers from the particle impoverishment problem, which can lead to the misleading state estimation results. To cope with this problem, a modified particle filter, i.e., intelligent particle filter (IPF), is proposed in this paper. It is inspired from the genetic algorithm. The particle impoverishment in general PF mainly results from the poverty of particle diversity. In IPF, the genetic-operators-based strategy is designed to further improve the particle diversity. It should be pointed out that the general PF is a special case of the proposed IPF with the specified parameters. Two experiment examples show that IPF mitigates particle impoverishment and provides more accurate state estimation results compared with the general PF. Finally, the proposed IPF is implemented for real-time fault detection on a three-tank system, and the results are satisfactory.},

A brief description of the satellite structure is outlined in order to highlight the main sources of uncertainty and disturbance affecting the monitored system. The satellite nominal and faulty conditions are simulated by means of an industry standard non-linear model implementation in the MATLAB® and SIMULINK® environments. A comparison with the existing fault diagnosis scheme implemented on board the \{MEX\} is also reported. Suitable performance criteria are introduced together with Monte Carlo analysis for both design tuning and assessing the robustness and performance evaluation of the complete \{FDI\} design strategy. },

The FDI scheme is based on a hybrid model (composed of an analytical nominal model and a neural network model) of the nonlinear system. The nominal performance of the system in fault free operation is governed by analytical model whereas the uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics are accounted for by intelligent (neural network based) model. The neural network weights are updated based on a modified backpropagation scheme. The stability of the overall fault detection scheme is shown using Lyapunov's direct method. To evaluate the performance of the proposed fault detection scheme, FDI in a spacecraft attitude control systems with reaction wheel type of actuators is considered as a case study.

A new method for computing the probability of a fault given multiple different types of residuals processors is presented. The method uses the Shiryayev sequential probability ratio test to estimate the probability of the presence of a fault signal given the residuals generated from either parity relationships or fault detection filters, a fault map of the impact of each fault signal on the residuals, and an adaptive fault estimation scheme that enables processing with fewer residuals. This new methodology is applied to the detection of the fault signals in the attitude control system and navigation system of deep space satellites. First a sensor fusion process is presented for blending star tracker data, gyro data, accelerometer data, and information from the vehicle control system to form the best estimate of the navigation state. Then a set of fault detection filters are developed that detect and uniquely identify faults in each of the sensors or actuators. Decision-making is handled through the sequential processing. Simulation results for a single-satellite system are presented.},

The analysis secondly yields that variable reconstruction affects the geometry of the \{PCA\} decomposition. The paper further introduces an improved variable reconstruction method for identifying multiple sensor and process faults and for isolating their influence upon the recorded process variables. It is shown that this can accommodate the effect of reconstruction, i.e. changes in the covariance matrix of the sensor readings and correctly re-defining the PCA-based monitoring statistics and their confidence limits. },

The feature of the proposed approach is that the controller is designed only using the input-output (I/O) measurement data of the system by means of a novel dynamic linearization technique with a new concept termed pseudogradient (PG). Moreover, the predictive function is implemented in the controller using a lazy-learning (LL)-based PG predictive algorithm, such that the controller not only shows good robustness but also can realize the effect of model-free adaptive prediction for the sudden change of the desired signal. Further, since the LL technique has the characteristic of database queries, both the online and offline I/O measurement data are fully and simultaneously utilized to real-time adjust the controller parameters during the control process. Moreover, the stability of the proposed method is guaranteed by rigorous mathematical analysis. Meanwhile, the numerical simulations and the laboratory experiments implemented on a practical three-tank water level control system both verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Use of a poor dynamic model with this kind of model-based decoupling and linearizing scheme, however, may result in performance that is inferior to a much simpler, fixed-gain scheme.In this paper, we develop a parameter-adaptive control scheme in a set of adaptive laws that can be added to the nonlinear, model-based controller. The scheme is unique be cause it is designed specifically for the nonlinear, model- based controller and has been proven stable in a full, nonlin ear setting. After adaptation, the error dynamics of the joints are decoupled with uniform disturbance rejection in all ma nipulator configurations. The issues of sufficient excitation and the effect of disturbances are also discussed.The theory is demonstrated with simulation results and also with data from an implementation for an industrial robot, the Adept One. },

This paper presents a dynamic data-driven approach to accurately detect precursors to the combustion instability phenomena. In particular, grey-scale images of combustion flames have been used in combination with pressure time-series data for information fusion to detect and predict flame instabilities in the combustion process. These grey-scale images are analyzed using deep belief network (DBN). The cross-dependencies between the features extracted by the DBN and the symbolic sequences generated from pressure time-series are then analyzed using ×D-Markov (pronounced cross D-Markov) models that are constructed by a combination of state-splitting and cross-entropy rate; this leads to the development of a variable-memory cross-model as a representation of the underlying physical process. These cross-models are then used for detection and prediction of combustion instability phenomena. The proposed concept is validated on experimental data collected from a laboratory-scale swirl-stabilized combustor apparatus, where the instability phenomena are induced by typical protocols leading to unstable flames.},

The aim is to show the capabilities and drawbacks of the methods, and propose a strategy for the aggregation of their outcomes, to overcome their limitations. For this purpose, the performance of each method is evaluated in terms of fault detection capability, considering accuracy, robustness, and resistance to the spillover effect of the obtained signal reconstructions.

This assumption is likely to be violated in practical settings as new fault types can emerge over time. In this paper we study this often overlooked cold start learning problem in data-driven fault detection, where in the beginning only normal operation data are available and faulty operation data become available as the faults occur. We explored how to leverage strengths of unsupervised and supervised approaches to build a model capable of detecting faults even if none are still observed, and of improving over time, as new fault types are observed. The proposed framework was evaluated on the benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process data. The proposed fusion model performed better on both unseen and seen faults than the stand-alone unsupervised and supervised models.},

  abstract = {The state prediction based on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for nonlinear stochastic discrete-time systems with linear measurement equation is investigated. Predicting future states by using the information of available measurements is an effective method to solve time delay problems. It not only helps the system operator to perform security analysis, but also allows more time for operator to take better decision in case of emergency. In addition, predictive state can make the system implement real-time monitoring and achieve good robustness. UKF has been popular in state prediction because of its advantages in handling nonlinear systems. However, the accuracy of prediction degrades notably once a filter uses a much longer future prediction. A confidence interval (CI) is proposed to overcome the problem. The advantages of CI are that it provides the information about states coverage, which is useful for treatment-plan evaluation, and it can be directly used to specify the margin to accommodate prediction errors. Meanwhile, the CI of prediction errors can be used to correct the predictive state, and thereby it improves the prediction accuracy. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

In parameters re-estimation step, the active-set optimisation is combined with the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm in M-step and the active set-based EM algorithm is proposed to re-estimate HMM parameters when inequality constraints are not satisfied in pre-estimation. An auxiliary function is devised for reconstructing the optimisation objective function and the convergence of the proposed algorithm is also demonstrated.

Once a fault is detected, how to investigate the root causes of the fault by isolating the true faulty variables without any historical fault information is a challenging problem. Inspired by the idea of the contribution analysis (CA) methods developed in the frame of the principal component analysis (PCA), in this paper, a novel isolation index will be provided by decomposing the kNN distance used as the detection index in kNN-based fault detection method. The commonly used CA-based isolation methods suffer from smearing effect due to the correlation among the defined isolation indices, thus prone to misdiagnosis. The proposed isolation index is defined in the original measurement space without correlation. Moreover, theoretical analysis of the isolability for the proposed fault isolation method shows that it can isolate multiple sensor faults under a less strict condition than that used in the analysis of those CA-based fault isolation methods. The numerical examples and Tennessee Eastman (TE) benchmark process are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

As a matter of fact, an FDD system is a data-processing system on the basis of information redundancy, in which the data and human's understanding of the data are two fundamental elements. Human's understanding may be an explicit input-output model representing the relationship among the system's variables. It may also be represented as knowledge implicitly (e.g., the connection weights of a neural network). Therefore, FDD is done through some kind of modeling, signal processing, and intelligence computation. In this paper, a variety of FDD techniques are reviewed within the unified data-processing framework to give a full picture of FDD and achieve a new level of understanding. According to the types of data and how the data are processed, the FDD methods are classified into three categories: model-based online data-driven methods, signal-based methods, and knowledge-based history data-driven methods. An outlook to the possible evolution of FDD in industrial automation, including the hybrid FDD and the emerging networked FDD, are also presented to reveal the future development direction in this field.},

  abstract = {Fault detection and diagnosis is an important problem in process engineering. It is the central component of abnormal event management (AEM) which has attracted a lot of attention recently. \{AEM\} deals with the timely detection, diagnosis and correction of abnormal conditions of faults in a process. Early detection and diagnosis of process faults while the plant is still operating in a controllable region can help avoid abnormal event progression and reduce productivity loss. Since the petrochemical industries lose an estimated 20 billion dollars every year, they have rated \{AEM\} as their number one problem that needs to be solved. Hence, there is considerable interest in this field now from industrial practitioners as well as academic researchers, as opposed to a decade or so ago. There is an abundance of literature on process fault diagnosis ranging from analytical methods to artificial intelligence and statistical approaches. From a modelling perspective, there are methods that require accurate process models, semi-quantitative models, or qualitative models. At the other end of the spectrum, there are methods that do not assume any form of model information and rely only on historic process data. In addition, given the process knowledge, there are different search techniques that can be applied to perform diagnosis. Such a collection of bewildering array of methodologies and alternatives often poses a difficult challenge to any aspirant who is not a specialist in these techniques. Some of these ideas seem so far apart from one another that a non-expert researcher or practitioner is often left wondering about the suitability of a method for his or her diagnostic situation. While there have been some excellent reviews in this field in the past, they often focused on a particular branch, such as analytical models, of this broad discipline. The basic aim of this three part series of papers is to provide a systematic and comparative study of various diagnostic methods from different perspectives. We broadly classify fault diagnosis methods into three general categories and review them in three parts. They are quantitative model-based methods, qualitative model-based methods, and process history based methods. In the first part of the series, the problem of fault diagnosis is introduced and approaches based on quantitative models are reviewed. In the remaining two parts, methods based on qualitative models and process history data are reviewed. Furthermore, these disparate methods will be compared and evaluated based on a common set of criteria introduced in the first part of the series. We conclude the series with a discussion on the relationship of fault diagnosis to other process operations and on emerging trends such as hybrid blackboard-based frameworks for fault diagnosis.},

Impact has developed a prognostic and health management (PHM) methodology for these critical systems that includes signal processing and neural network tracking techniques, along with automated reasoning, classification, knowledge fusion, and probabilistic failure mode progression algorithms. The processing utilizes the command/response signal and hydraulic pressure data from the actuators and provides a real-time assessment of the current/future actuator health state. This methodology was applied to F/A-18 stabilator electro-hydraulic servo valves (EHSVs) using test stand data provided by Boeing Phantom works. The automated module demonstrated excellent health state classification results. The prognosis was also successfully performed however no data was available to validate the prediction. These algorithms were developed with consideration to sensor/processing limitations for potential onboard implementation. Many of the PHM elements presented here could also be adapted for other actuator types and applications.},

  abstract  = {Modern industrial system is becoming more and more complex in order to produce the goods with high quality or achieve the functional requirements set by human beings. However, once the faults occur in the system, it's highly possible that the financial losses and even the operators' death may be caused. Therefore, it's necessary to improve the reliability of the system. The data-based fault diagnosis scheme is an important approach to realize the fault-tolerant control to further secure the system operation in the normal condition. This paper concentrates on the multivariate statistical analyses included in the framework of data-based scheme, more specifically, Total Projection to Latent Structures (TPLS). Although the traditional TPLS has achieved effective monitoring results in some practical applications, it should be noted that the decomposition principle of process variables is not appropriate. Furthermore, the test statistic it chooses can not reflect the subspaces they monitored. Both of the weaknesses make TPLS useless in some circumstances. To solve the problems, this paper proposes a Modified TPLS (MTPLS) based on TPLS, statistics theory and matrix analysis. Compared with TPLS, MTPLS has better fault diagnosis performance. A numerical example is used to validate the effectiveness of TPLS.},

abstract={This paper investigates the distributed adaptive control problems for nonlinear vehicle-following systems subject to nonlinear acceleration uncertainties involving vehicle acceleration disturbances, wind gusts, and parameter uncertainties. It is worth mentioning that the acceleration of the leader in most existing studies is always assumed to be zero or constant; the evolution of the leader in this paper may be subject to some unknown bounded input. Distributed adaptive control strategies based on an integral sliding mode control (ISMC) technique are proposed to maintain a rigid formation for a string of vehicle platoon in one dimension. First, distributed adaptive control based on traditional constant time headway (TCTH) policy under the assumption that the initial spacing and velocity errors are zero is developed to guarantee that all spacing errors are uniformly ultimately bounded and that the string stability of the whole vehicle platoon is also satisfied. Then, a modified constant time headway (MCTH) policy is proposed to remove the assumption of zero initial spacing and velocity errors and simultaneously effectively decrease the intervehicle spacing (i.e., increase the traffic density), making them nearly equal to those by using the constant spacing (CS) policy. Adaptive compensation terms without requiring a prior knowledge of upper bounds of the uncertainties are constructed to compensate for the time-variant effects caused by nonlinear acceleration uncertainties. Finally, numerical simulation results show the validity and advantages of the proposed policy up to a significant higher traffic density.},

  abstract = {In filtering, control, and other mathematical engineering areas, it is common to use a model-based approach, which splits the problem into two steps: 1) model identification and 2) model-based design. Despite its success, the model-based approach has the shortcoming that the design objective is not taken into account at the identification step, i.e., the model is not optimized for its intended use. This technical note proposes an approach for data-driven filtering and control that combines the identification and the model-based design into one joint problem. The signal of interest is modeled as a missing part of a trajectory of the data generating system. Subsequently, the missing data estimation problem is reformulated as a mosaic-Hankel structured matrix low-rank approximation/completion problem. A local optimization method, based on the variable projections principle, is then used for its numerical solution. The missing data estimation approach and the solution method proposed are illustrated on filtering and smoothing examples.},

The Internet-based three-tank system is an experimental setup that can be regarded as a typical networked system for evaluating networked fault-diagnosis and fault-tolerant control methods. Packet dropout phenomenon in the sensor-to-controller link is considered in this paper, and the fault type we deal with is chosen as the sensor bias fault. Fault-diagnosis unit is designed toward an auxiliary system. Sensor bias faults can be detected by comparing the residual signal generated by the fault detection filter and a prescribed threshold. After that, the fault can be isolated by using the residual analysis approach. Once the fault is isolated, it can be estimated iteratively in the least-squares sense. A fault accommodation method is proposed, and a fault-tolerant control strategy is achieved based on the fault information provided by the fault-diagnosis unit. The approach brought forward in this paper is demonstrated via an experimental study on the practical Internet-based three-tank system. Results show the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed techniques.},

  abstract = {Abstract The control algorithm hierarchy of motion control for over-actuated mechanical systems with a redundant set of effectors and actuators commonly includes three levels. First, a high-level motion control algorithm commands a vector of virtual control efforts (i.e. forces and moments) in order to meet the overall motion control objectives. Second, a control allocation algorithm coordinates the different effectors such that they together produce the desired virtual control efforts, if possible. Third, low-level control algorithms may be used to control each individual effector via its actuators. Control allocation offers the advantage of a modular design where the high-level motion control algorithm can be designed without detailed knowledge about the effectors and actuators. Important issues such as input saturation and rate constraints, actuator and effector fault tolerance, and meeting secondary objectives such as power efficiency and tear-and-wear minimization are handled within the control allocation algorithm. The objective of the present paper is to survey control allocation algorithms, motivated by the rapidly growing range of applications that have expanded from the aerospace and maritime industries, where control allocation has its roots, to automotive, mechatronics, and other industries. The survey classifies the different algorithms according to two main classes based on the use of linear or nonlinear models, respectively. The presence of physical constraints (e.g input saturation and rate constraints), operational constraints and secondary objectives makes optimization-based design a powerful approach. The simplest formulations allow explicit solutions to be computed using numerical linear algebra in combination with some logic and engineering solutions, while the more challenging formulations with nonlinear models or complex constraints and objectives call for iterative numerical optimization procedures. Experiences using the different methods in aerospace, maritime, automotive and other application areas are discussed. The paper ends with some perspectives on new applications and theoretical challenges. },

However, further studies find that these methods gradually lose their functions when amplitudes of quality-unrelated faults increase; in addition, they still consume a relatively large amount of calculation load in practice. In this brief, we propose a new structure of preprocessing-modeling-postprocessing, within which modified orthogonal projections to latent structures (MOPLS) method is developed. Compared with the previous approaches, the new method significantly improves the performance of quality-related fault detection. In addition, it reduces the number of required latent variables, thus it has a quite lower computational load than the previous ones. A numerical example and the Tennessee Eastman process are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The baseline controller is obtained by an iterative LMI method, which not only stabilizes the uncertain system but also provides sufficient robustness to allow for an effective operation of the fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) subsystem in the event of actuator failures. The re-allocation scheme redesigns an optimal control law without requiring reconfiguration of the baseline controller, and compensates for actuator saturation via cascaded generalized inverse (CGI) method.

The proposed FDI approach employs recurrent neural network-based observers for simultaneously detecting, isolating and identifying the severity of actuator faults in presence of disturbances and uncertainties in the model and sensory measurements. The neural network weights are updated based on a modified dynamic backpropagation scheme. The proposed FDI scheme does not rely on the availability of full state measurements. In most works in the literature the fault function acts as an additive term on the actuator, whereas in this work the fault acts as a multiplicative term. This will make the formal stability and convergence analysis of the overall FDI scheme nontrivial and challenging. Our stability analysis considers the presence of plant and sensor uncertainties through the use of Lyapunov's direct method with no restrictive assumptions on the system and/or the FDI algorithm. The performance of our proposed FDI approach is evaluated through simulations that are performed for two case studies, namely FDI of 1) reaction wheel type actuators that are commonly utilized in the attitude control subsystem (ACS) of a satellite and 2) actuators in a two-link flexible joint manipulator.},

In order to achieve these objectives, three dynamic neural networks are introduced to model the dynamics of the wheels on all three axes independently. Due to the dynamic property of the wheel, the architecture utilized is the Elman recurrent network with backpropagation learning algorithm. The effectiveness of this neural network-based FDI scheme is investigated and a comparative study is conducted with the performance of a generalized observer-based scheme.

To make the optimization feasible for on-line application, the optimal estimation functions are approximated by MLP neural networks thus reducing the functional optimization problem to a nonlinear programming problem, namely, the optimization of the neural weights.

  abstract = {Spacecraft are generally designed with very high reliability to operate for many years through fault avoidance practices. But, in spite of fault avoidance, faults do occur. Hence there is a need for on-board fault detection and isolation without creating significant degradation in the spacecraft services. Analytical redundancy or model reference method of fault detection provides such a solution as most spacecraft are now equipped with an on-board computer, which is an ideal platform for implementing the analytical redundancy based fault detection algorithms. In this paper, analytical redundancy based fault detection technique has been applied for detecting the faults in gyroscopes used in a three-axis stabilized low earth orbiting satellite like the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) spacecraft. The scheme proposed is an observer based on a dynamic model having attitude and rates as states and the gyro sensed rates and the horizon sensor outputs as measurements. The torque computed by the \{AOCS\} processor is used as the control input for this observer. Eigen-structure assignment approach has been applied to the design of this dedicated fault detection observer. Design exercise has been carried out using \{MATLAB\} tools. Spacecraft dynamics and kinematic equations, the models for gyroscopes and the other sensors, the on-orbit normal mode controller have been included in the simulations. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to validate the design and the results are presented. It is believed that this approach will help in achieving the larger goal of autonomy in spacecraft.},

Since standard PLS performs oblique projection to input space X, it has limitations in distinguishing quality-related and quality-unrelated faults. Several postprocessing modifications of PLS, such as total projection to latent structures (T-PLS), have been proposed to solve this issue. Further studies have found that these modifications fail to reduce false alarm rates (FARs) of quality-unrelated faults when fault amplitude increases. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes an enhanced quality-related fault detection approach based on orthogonal signal correction (OSC) and modified-PLS (M-PLS). The proposed approach removes variation orthogonal to output space Y from input space X before PLS modeling, and further decomposes X into two orthogonal subspaces in which quality-related and quality-unrelated statistical indicators are designed separately. Compared with T-PLS, the proposed approach has a more robust performance and a lower computational load. Two case studies, including a numerical example and the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process, show the effeteness of the proposed approach.},

This IMM-FDI filter provides not only failure detection and identification but also a near-optimal estimate of the system state (even during a failure). The approach has been applied successfully to a problem of spacecraft autonomy for the detection and identification of sensor (gyro, star tracker) and actuator failures. The results of this application show that IMM-EKF detects and identifies failures much more rapidly and reliably than the multi-hypothesis EKF.

Two tools for distributing the control effort among a redundant set of actuators are optimal control design and control allocation. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between these two design tools when the performance indexes are quadratic in the control input. We show that for a particular class of nonlinear systems, they give exactly the same design freedom in distributing the control effort among the actuators. Linear quadratic optimal control is contained as a special case. A benefit of using a separate control allocator is that actuator constraints can be considered, which is illustrated with a flight control example. },

On one hand, this redundancy improves the helicopter's safety margin and on the other hand, it extends the \{FTC\} methods that can be flying-tested on the quadrotor with more severe faults/damages. For illustration, control re-allocation is employed as a fault-tolerant control method in the presence of actuator faults. Some experimental results using the quadrotor testbed at the Networked Autonomous Vehicles (NAV) Lab of the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering of Concordia University are given to illustrate the capabilities of the modified \{UAV\} system. },

In degraded actuator conditions, a reconfigured control allocation strategy is proposed based on the on-line re-estimation of actuators health.

The analysis is developed for a system consisting of a fixed number of actuators. In addition, the system includes a scheme to detect failures in individual actuators and, as a consequence, switch between different control algorithms for automatic operation of the actuators. Existing dynamic reliability analysis methods are insufficient for this class of systems because the coverage parameters for different actuator failures can be time-varying, correlated, and difficult to obtain in practice. We address these issues by combining new fault detection performance metrics with pivotal decomposition. These new metrics capture the interactions in different fault detection channels, and can be computed from stochastic models of fault detection algorithms. Our approach also decouples the high dimensional analysis problem into low dimensional sub-problems, yielding a computationally efficient analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed method on a numerical example. The analysis results are also verified by Monte Carlo simulations. },

This paper proposes an improved faults detection, reconstruction and fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme for motor systems (MS) with typical faults. For this purpose, a sliding mode controller (SMC) with an integral sliding surface is adopted. This controller can make the output of system to track the desired position reference signal in finite-time and obtain a better dynamic response and anti-disturbance performance. But this controller cannot deal directly with total system failures. However an appropriate combination of the adopted \{SMC\} and sliding mode observer (SMO), later it is designed to on-line detect and reconstruct the faults and also to give a sensorless control strategy which can achieve tolerance to a wide class of total additive failures. The closed-loop stability is proved, using the Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation results in healthy and faulty conditions confirm the reliability of the suggested framework. },

Compared with the well-developed model-based approaches, data-based techniques provide efficient alternative solutions for different industrial issues under various operating conditions. The main objective of this paper is to review and summarize the recent achievements in data-based techniques, especially for complicated industrial applications, thus providing a referee for further study on the related topics both from academic and practical points of view. This paper begins with a brief evolutionary overview of data-based techniques in the last two decades.

  abstract = {This paper deals with the adaptive reliable H∞ optimization control problem for linear time-delayed systems (LTDSs) against time-varying actuator faults. A novel delay-dependent adaptive H∞ performance index is described for LTDSs. An exponential function term has been successfully introduced to establish a novel actuator fault parameters estimation scheme. Moreover, the designed indirect adaptive controller includes both offline and online gains, which can be obtained by robust optimization technique and adaptive fault parameters estimation, respectively. By employing an improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and applying some new-developed integral inequalities technique, some delay-dependent sufficient conditions with less conservatism are established to make the closed-loop systems exponentially stable and have the optimized adaptive delay-dependent H∞ performance index. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the presented scheme are demonstrated by two examples.},

  abstract  = {Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the parameter space approach to control system analysis and design. The original concept has a long history starting in Russia by Vishnegradsky in 1876 and spreading throughout the world by the works of Neimark, Aizerman, Mitrovic, Meerov, Thaler, Seltzer, Ackermann, and many others. The parameter space approach has generally been viewed as an alternative to the classical methods of Routh-Hurwitz, Nyquist, Evans, Bode, and Nichols. When in the sixties the advent of the LQG theory of Kalman decreased the interest in classical design techniques, it almost diminished applications of the parameter methods. A recent widespread interest in robust design of control systems subject to structured perturbations shifted a considerable part of the research activity toward parameter space methods, and, at the same time, enlarged the scope of the approach to include the Liapunov's method as well as frequency domain concepts. The purpose of this paper is to review new and significant developments in the robust control design for structured (parametric) perturbations, which complement the large and well represented effort in robust design of control systems under structured and unstructured perturbations via frequency domain characterizations.

  abstract = {Abstract This paper is concerned with the reliable controller design for hybrid-driven nonlinear systems via T–S fuzzy model with probabilistic actuator faults and probabilistic nonlinear perturbations. To reduce unnecessary transmissions in the network, a hybrid-driven scheme is introduced, in which the communication transmission scheme can be selected between time-driven scheme and event-driven scheme. The switch law of the communication schemes is modeled as Bernoulli distributed stochastic variable. Considering the network-induced delay, nonlinear perturbations and the probabilistic actuator faults, a new model is constructed under the hybrid driven scheme. By using Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals and stochastic analysis techniques, sufficient conditions are established which ensure the asymptotical stability of the augmented system under hybrid driven scheme. Furthermore, a unified co-design algorithm for the desired controller and the hybrid-driven scheme are developed. Finally, a typical simulation example is used to demonstrate the validity of obtained results. },

It outlines the principles and most important techniques of model-based residual generation using parameter identification and state estimation methods with emphasis upon the latest attempts to achieve robustness with respect to modelling errors. A solution to the fundamental problem of robust fault detection, providing the maximum achievable robustness by decoupling the effects of faults from each other and from the effects of modelling errors, is given. This approach not only completes the theory but is also of great importance for practical applications. For the case where the prerequisites for complete decoupling are not given, two approximate solutions—one in the time domain and one in the frequency domain—are presented, and the crossconnections to earlier approaches are evidenced. The resulting observer schemes for robust instrument fault detection, component fault detection, and actuator fault detection are briefly discussed. Finally, the basic scheme of fault diagnosis using a combination of analytical and knowledge-based redundancy is outlined.},

  abstract = {For further improvement of the reliability and safety of machines the automatic early detection and localization of faults is of high interest. The conventional approach is to monitor some important variables like temperature, pressure, vibration and to generate alarms if certain limits are exceeded. However, developing internal faults are in this way only detected at a rather late stage. By applying static and dynamic process models and common process input and output measurements the inherent relationships and redundancies can be used to detect faults earlier and to localize them better. Changes in process and signal parameters are very well suited for fault detection. The paper describes a general methodology for machines and other processes by using few measurements, dynamic process and signal models and parameter estimation to generate analytical symptoms. Heuristic symptoms observed by the operator or based on, e.g. the process history are another source for fault diagnosis. Both kinds of symptoms are weighted by confidence measures and are fed into a knowledge based fault diagnosis procedure. The diagnosis is performed by forward and backward chaining according to causal fault-symptom trees. The considered machines consist of a motor, a drive chain and a working process or load. They may be electrical motor or combustion engine driven pumps, fans or machine tools with gear or belt drive chains. As one example, experimental results are shown for a DC motor powered feed drive of a machine tool. A summary of practical results with other machines is also given.},

  abstract = {Often in control design it is necessary to construct estimates of state variables which are not available by direct measurement. If a system is linear, its state vector can be approximately reconstructed by building an observer which is itself a linear system driven by the available outputs and inputs of the original system. The state vector of annth order system withmindependent outputs can be reconstructed with an observer of ordern-m. In this paper it is shown that the design of an observer for a system withMoutputs can be reduced to the design ofmseparate observers for single-output subsystems. This result is a consequence of a special canonical form developed in the paper for multiple-output systems. In the special case of reconstruction of a single linear functional of the unknown state vector, it is shown that a great reduction in observer complexity is often possible. Finally, the application of observers to control design is investigated. It is shown that an observer's estimate of the system state vector can be used in place of the actual state vector in linear or nonlinear feedback designs without loss of stability.},

This significantly extends previous results by considering a more general class of system nonlinearities which are modeled as functions of the system input and partially measurable state variables. A new \{FDI\} method is developed using adaptive estimation techniques. The \{FDI\} architecture consists of a fault detection estimator and a bank of fault isolation estimators. The fault detectability and isolability conditions, characterizing the class of faults that are detectable and isolable by the proposed scheme, are rigorously established. The fault isolability condition is derived via the so-called fault mismatch functions, which are defined to characterize the mutual difference between pairs of possible faults. A simulation example of a single-link flexible joint robot is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. },

  abstract = {The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is one of the most popular model-based techniques for fault detection and diagnosis. Although its effectiveness has been widely recognized, the practical applications of EKFs are still very limited. This is due to the fact that the estimates of EKF are often biased when the occurrence of multiple faults is possible. In this study, we have extended the findings of our previous research on diagnostic observability and diagnostic resolution concerning a set of parallel single-parameter EKFs (Chang et al., 1993, A.I.Ch.E. J.39, 1146) to the multiple-parameter EKFs which are designed to identify more than one fault origin. The problems in implementing these EKFs, i.e. misdiagnosis due to biased estimates and heavy computation load due to the parallel configuration, have been solved with a selection strategy for proper combinations of sensor locations and EKF parameters. More importantly, simple procedures have been developed to quickly evaluate the performance of any given system and the reliability of the proposed approach has been repeatedly confirmed in extensive simulation studies without exceptions. As a result, it becomes feasible to construct appropriate fault monitoring schemes without extensive computational effort even for large and complex chemical processes.},

Performance comparisons are made between filters using the inertial navigation equations and the dynamic model for the fault-free conditions.

However, there is always some mismatch between the modeled and the real process behavior. Then, any model-based fault detection algorithm should be robust against modeling errors. One possible approach to take into account modeling uncertainty is to include all the uncertainty in system parameters using an interval model that allows generating an adaptive threshold. In this paper, the use of interval models in robust fault detection considering three schemes (simulation, prediction, or observation) is presented and discussed. The main contribution is to present a comparative study that allows identifying the benefits and drawbacks of using each scheme. This study will provide a guideline for the use of the proposed fault detection schemes in real applications.

In order to ensure reliable fault detection, the adaptive threshold technique is used to deal with the problem. The paper focuses also on the N-F model design procedure. The bounded-error approach is applied to generate rules for the model using available data.

The parity relations are applied directly to the observables of the monitored plant; the design relies on the plant's dynamic input-output model. This residual generator can be made computationally polynomial (moving average) by including the invariant zero polynomial of the fault system in the specified fault responses. The polynomial design yields moving average noise transfers as well. White noise transfer and disturbance decoupling are achieved by extending the response specification. The parity relation approach is compared with the traditional detection filter design, and is shown to be more straightforward and have milder existence conditions; if subjected to the same specification, the two approaches yield identical residual generators.},

By suitable assignment of the eigenstructure of an observer, the residual signal is decoupled from disturbances. The main contribution of this work is the novel use of right eigenvector assignment of observers, which gives more freedom for achieving disturbance decoupling. It is shown that, when decoupling conditions are satisfied, the resulting deadbeat design is equivalent to the first-order parity space structure for residual generation. Two tutorial examples are presented to illustrate the disturbance decoupling property and the conditions under which left or right eigenvectors are assignable},

The emphasis is on modelling errors, represented as multiplicative disturbances, and on parametric faults. These are both characterized as discrepancies in a set of underlying parameters. The residuals are obtained using parity equations. To address the situation when the number of uncertain parameters is too high to allow perfect decoupling, two approximate decoupling methods are introduced. One utilizes rank reduction of the model-error/fault entry matrix via singular value decomposition. The other minimizes a least squares performance index, formulated on the residuals, under a set of equality constraints. It is shown that, by the appropriate construction of the entry matrix or of the performance index and the constraints, a broad variety of structured and directional residual strategies can be implemented. },

  abstract = { Fault detection filters are a special class of observers that can generate directional residuals for the purpose of fault isolation. This paper proposes a new approach to design robust (in the disturbance de-coupling sense) fault detection filters which ensure that the residual vector, generated by this filter, has both robust and directional properties. This is done by combining the unknown input observer and fault detection filter principles. The paper proposes a new full-order unknown input observer, and gives necessary and sufficient conditions for its existence. After the disturbance de-coupling conditions are satisfied, the remaining design freedom can be used to make the residual have the directional property, based on the fault detection filter principle. A nonlinear jet engine system is used to illustrate the robust fault isolation approach presented. It is shown that linearization errors can be approximately treated as unknown disturbances and be de-coupled in the design of a robust fault detection filter. Simulation results show that mis-isolation of faults can be avoided using the robust scheme. },

  abstract  = {With an emphasis on fault isolation and by treating fault detection as a byproduct of fault isolation, both actuator and sensor fault detection and isolation (FDI) problems for a class of uncertain Lipschitz nonlinear systems are studied using an unknown input observer (UIO) design technique. To solve the actuator fault detection and isolation problem, we develop a particular system structure by regrouping the system inputs, which is suitable for UIO design. By filtering the regrouped outputs properly, the same system structure can be developed for sensor fault detection and isolation problem, which allows us to treat the sensor fault detection and isolation problem as an actuator fault detection and isolation problem. To accomplish FDI efficiently, a novel full order nonlinear UIO is designed with a special property suitable for fault isolation purposes and a necessary and sufficient condition for its existence are presented. The LMI based sufficient condition enables the designers to use Matlab LMI toolbox and makes the computationally difficult UIO design much easier. For UIO based FDI, the following three problems are investigated: 1) under what conditions is it possible to isolate single and/or multiple faults? 2) What is the maximum number of faults that can be isolated simultaneously? 3) How to design fault isolation schemes to achieve multiple fault isolation (that is, to make decisions on how many faults have occurred and the location of each fault)? Conditions for problem 1) are derived and the maximum number of faults that can be isolated is determined for problem 2) to solve problem 3) an FDI scheme is designed using a bank of nonlinear UIOs and its design procedure is presented in a step by step fashion. An example is given to show how to use the proposed FDI scheme and simulations results illustrate that the proposed technique works well for FDI in uncertain Lipschitz nonlinear systems},

A test is proposed to check if all \{FDI\} objectives are achieved for all specified model perturbations.

In the specific case when a reconstruction of the fault signal is needed the dynamic inversion based approach will be investigated. This approach will also be studied from geometric point of view. The geometric approach, as proposed by Isidori and De Persis, is suitable to extend the detection filter and unknown input observer design approaches (well elaborated for \{LTI\} systems) to affine nonlinear systems. Beyond the development of the theory of fault detection and identification it is equally important to offer computable methods and to analyze the robustness properties against uncertainties.

  abstract = { In this article the idea of inversion-based direct input reconstruction for robust detection, separation and estimation of multiple simultaneous faults in the presence of persistent disturbances which proved to be non-separable by conventional decoupling methods in linear dynamical systems is presented. In particular, it is shown how in a specific filtering structure a residual generator, relying on the inverse representation of the system, by means of estimation of the inverse dynamics can be designed providing robust fault decoupling. In the development of the method three solution approaches are contrasted with each other. In the first approach the traditional H ∞ filter providing the classical disturbance attenuated non-decoupling solution is presented. Then, in a novel solution, an H ∞ detection filter on the inverse system is designed providing detection residuals by exact fault decoupling; the estimation of the inverse dynamics is obtained by means of the optimal filter, thus ensuring H ∞ disturbance attenuation on the residual output. Finally, an observer-based residual generator for the estimation of the inverse dynamics is designed resulting in detection residuals with exact fault and disturbance separation, which characterises this novel idea in its extremes. The feasibility of the solution to problems not solvable earlier is demonstrated based on an aircraft monitoring application example that was originally considered in Douglas and Speyer (1995) and Chung and Speyer (1998). },

The behavior of the aircraft is described by a nonlinear control-affine model, which is closed-loop controlled by a classical guidance, navigation and control (GNC) algorithm. The proposed FDI procedure exploits the redundancy induced by this control module, along with the accelerations measured by the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Estimates of first-order derivatives of some state variables are thus readily available and allow one to estimate the control inputs as achieved by the actuators. Since the computed control input sent to the actuator is known, it is possible to use the discrepancy between these two elements as a residual indicative of faults. This strategy is successfully applied to the proposed aeronautical benchmark to detect and isolate actuator faults affecting simultaneously flight control surfaces and propulsion.},

In comparison with the \{SPE\} index, the threshold setting associated with the new statistic is computationally simpler. Our further study is dedicated to the analysis of fault sensitivity. We consider the off-set and scaling faults, and evaluate the test statistic by viewing its sensitivity to the faults. Our final study focuses on identifying off-set and scaling faults.

  abstract  = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful fault detection and isolation method. However, the classical PCA which is based on the estimation of the sample mean and covariance matrix of the data is very sensitive to outliers in the training data set. Usually robust principal component analysis was applied to remove the effect of outliers on the PCA model. In this paper, a fast two-step algorithm is proposed. First, the objective was to find a robust PCA model that could be used for outliers detection and isolation. Hence a scale-M estimator (R.A. Maronna, 2005) is used to determine a robust model. This estimator is computed using an iterative re-weighted least squares (IRWLS) procedure. This algorithm is initialized from a very simple estimate derived from a one-step weighted variance-covariance estimate (A. Ruiz-Gazen, 1996). Second, structured residuals are used for multiple fault detection and isolation. These structured residuals are based on the reconstruction principle and the existence condition of such residuals is used to determine the detectable faults and the isolable faults. The proposed scheme avoids the combinatorial explosion of faulty scenarios related to multiple faults to consider. Then, this procedure for outliers detection and isolation is successfully applied to an example with multiple faults.},

The proposed strategy is able to isolate the effect of noise and process changes from the effects of physical changes in the sensor itself. For comparison we applied all of the tests and diagnoses to the original signal itself as well as to the wavelet details. To demonstrate the circumstances under which the above strategy might be used, a simulated noisy signal from a CSTR and a temperature signal from an operating pilot distillation column were analyzed. Faults were introduced into the thermocouple, and the diagnosis carried out. The results of the diagnosis indicated that the proposed strategy had low type I (false alarm) and type II (failure to detect faults) errors. },

The basic idea of \{KPCA\} is to first map the input space into a feature space via nonlinear mapping and then to compute the principal components in that feature space. In comparison to other nonlinear principal component analysis (PCA) techniques, \{KPCA\} requires only the solution of an eigenvalue problem and does not entail any nonlinear optimization. In addition, the number of principal components need not be specified prior to modeling. In this paper, a simple approach to calculating the squared prediction error (SPE) in the feature space is also suggested. Based on \{T2\} and \{SPE\} charts in the feature space, \{KPCA\} was applied to fault detection in two example systems: a simple multivariate process and the simulation benchmark of the biological wastewater treatment process. The proposed approach effectively captured the nonlinear relationship in the process variables and showed superior process monitoring performance compared to linear PCA. },

  abstract = {Although satellites are designed with high reliability, faults do occur when satellites are in orbit. To avoid the important services being affected, redundancy is used in satellites. There are many sensors in satellites. In order to reduce the cost, space, weight and power consumption, redundant sensors should be added to satellite as few as possible. Analytical redundancy is an efficient way to optimize the application of redundant. The gyroscope is the attitude determination sensor of the satellite. The minimum redundant structure of the gyroscope system is as follows: three gyroscopes installed in three-axis orthogonally and one gyroscope installed with slantwise for redundancy(3o+1S). To achieve fault detection, identification and reconstruction, hypothesis of statistical independence between the three-axis angular rates and hypothesis of statistical independence between the angular rates and fault are proposed. The scenario that only one sensor is faulting and there are only additive fault and full fault is supposed. Under these assumptions, firstly a threshold method is used for fault detection. After a fault is detected, independent component analysis (ICA) based algorithm for fault identification is employed. To overcome the ambiguities of ICA, correlation coefficients and prior information of the mixed matrix are used. Finally, the reconstruction matrix is obtained. By using this matrix fault signal is extracted so that the yaw, roll and pitch axes (three-axis) angular rates of the satellite can be recovered. Numerical simulations show this method can fulfill fault detection, identification and reconstruction of the gyroscope system. },

In this paper, several recursive partial least squares (RPLS) algorithms are proposed for on-line process modeling to adapt process changes and off-line modeling to deal with a large number of data samples. A block-wise RPLS algorithm is proposed with a moving window and forgetting factor adaptation schemes. The block-wise RPLS algorithm is also used off-line to reduce computation time and computer memory usage in PLS regression and cross-validation. As a natural extension, the recursive algorithm is extended to dynamic modeling and nonlinear modeling. An application of the block recursive PLS algorithm to a catalytic reformer is presented to adapt the model based on new data.},

  abstract    = {Recent approaches to fault detection and isolation (FDI) for dynamic systems using methods of integrating quantitative and qualitative model information, based upon artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are surveyed. In this study, the use of AI methods is considered an important extension to the quantitative model-based approach for residual generation in FDI. When quantitative models are not readily available, a correctly trained artificial neural network (ANN) can be used as a non-linear dynamic model of the system. However, the neural network does not easily provide insight into model behaviour; the model is explicit rather than implicit in form. This main difficulty can be overcome using qualitative modelling or rule-based inference methods. For example, fuzzy logic can be used together with state-space models or neural networks to enhance FDI diagnostic reasoning capabilities. The paper discusses the properties of several methods of combining quantitative and qualitative system information and their practical value for fault diagnosis of real process systems.},

The approach is based on a non-linear distance metric measured in a feature space. Just as in principal components analysis (PCA) and dynamic principal components analysis (DPCA), appropriate distance metrics and thresholds have been developed for fault detection. Fault diagnosis is then carried out using the SVM-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) feature selection method. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated by applying it on the benchmark Tennessee Eastman problem and on an industrial real-time Semiconductor etch process dataset. The algorithm has been compared with conventional techniques such as \{PCA\} and \{DPCA\} in terms of performance measures such as false alarm rates, detection latency and fault detection rates. It is shown that the proposed algorithm outperformed \{PCA\} and \{DPCA\} both in terms of detection and diagnosis of faults. },

Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods used in various stages of a pattern recognition system and identify research topics and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field},

IPLS is able to decompose the measurable process variables into the KPI-related and unrelated parts, respectively. Based on it, the corresponding test statistics are designed to offer meaningful fault diagnosis information and thus, the corresponding maintenance actions can be further taken to ensure the desired performance of the systems.

ART architectures are discussed that are neural networks that self-organize stable recognition codes in real time in response to arbitrary sequences of input patterns. Within such an ART architecture, the process of adaptive pattern recognition is a special case of the more general cognitive process of hypothesis discovery, testing, search, classification, and learning. This property opens up the possibility of applying ART systems to more general problems of adaptively processing large abstract information sources and databases. The main computational properties of these ART architectures are outlined and contrasted with those of alternative learning and recognition systems.<>},

Until the 1990's it was a purely theoretical analysis of the problem of function estimation from a given collection of data. In the middle of the 1990's new types of learning algorithms (called support vector machines) based on the developed theory were proposed. This made statistical learning theory not only a tool for the theoretical analysis but also a tool for creating practical algorithms for estimating multidimensional functions. This article presents a very general overview of statistical learning theory including both theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the theory. The goal of this overview is to demonstrate how the abstract learning theory established conditions for generalization which are more general than those discussed in classical statistical paradigms and how the understanding of these conditions inspired new algorithmic approaches to function estimation problems},

  abstract = {Abstract In April 2015, the number of operating High Speed Trains (HSTs) in the world has reached 3603. An efficient, effective and very reliable braking system is evidently very critical for trains running at a speed around 300 km/h. Failure of a highly reliable braking system is a rare event and, consequently, informative recorded data on fault conditions are scarce. This renders the fault detection problem a classification problem with highly unbalanced data. In this paper, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) framework, including feature selection, feature vector selection, model construction and decision boundary optimization, is proposed for tackling this problem. Feature vector selection can largely reduce the data size and, thus, the computational burden. The constructed model is a modified version of the least square SVM, in which a higher cost is assigned to the error of classification of faulty conditions than the error of classification of normal conditions. The proposed framework is successfully validated on a number of public unbalanced datasets. Then, it is applied for the fault detection of braking systems in HST: in comparison with several \{SVM\} approaches for unbalanced datasets, the proposed framework gives better results. },

For the early detections, to classify whether the signals is an early sign of faults or not in subtle signal difference is necessary. To the classification, this paper uses SVM (Support Vector Machine), which is one of a powerful classification technique of machine learning. Data in abnormal state of plants is obtained a few moments later after a fault occurs, hence in early stage of faults, the data of abnormal state is not available. Only measured data at normal state of plants is available in learning stage of the method. For a classification of such cases where only one side of data, which is from normal state, available, one class SVM is useful. In addition, to classify a very subtle signal as a signal of abnormal state, a high generalization ability is necessary for SVM. To get the high ability, a new kernel function, the generalized Gaussian function is used. To show the effectiveness of the method given in this paper, a simulation example of a water level control experimental plant is given.},

For the purpose of this article, the term ‘reconfigurable flight control’ is used to refer to software algorithms designed specifically to compensate for failures or damage of flight control effectors or lifting surfaces, using the remaining effectors to generate compensating forces and moments. This article will discuss initial research and flight testing of approaches based on explicit fault detection, isolation, and estimation, as well as later approaches based on continuously adaptive and intelligent control algorithms. In addition, approaches for trajectory reshaping of an impaired aircraft with reconfigurable inner loop control laws will be briefly discussed. Finally, there will be some discussion on current implementations of reconfigurable control to improve safety on production and flight test aircraft and remaining challenges to enable broader use of the technology, such as the difficulties of flight certification of these types of approaches. },

The overall multiple model predictive control scheme quickly identifies the nature and time instant of the failure, and carries out automatic reconfiguration of the control law achieving acceptable flight performance.

To further address actuator saturation problem, a modified fault tolerant control law is then presented to ensure that the resulting control signal will never incur saturation.

The system comprises of a satellite with two-oppositely placed solar flaps. The nonlinear model describing the system is used to derive an adaptive fault tolerant control law, based on Lyapunov stability theorem, in the presence of unknown, slow-varying satellite mass distribution and solar parameter. Using this control law the solar flaps are suitably rotated to achieve desired satellite attitude performance. The detailed numerical simulation of the governing nonlinear system equation of motion including the effects of various system parameters on the controller performance, establishes the feasibility of the proposed adaptive control strategy in comparison with the sliding mode control without adaptation. This paper also examines several scenarios including sudden failure of one of the solar flaps, occurrence of an abrupt blockage of one of the rotating solar flaps, and occurrence of a periodic actuator fault. The numerical results show the robustness of the proposed adaptive control scheme in controlling the satellite attitude in the presence of external disturbances as well as in the event of failure of one of the solar flaps.},

A common approximate function is used to avoid system chattering caused by such discontinuous control laws. The parameters of external disturbance and failure uncertainties are estimated directly by adaptive laws, and the desired stability and output tracking properties of the adaptive control system are analyzed. Finally, simulation results of a rigid satellite with six reaction wheels are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed adaptive actuator failure compensation scheme. },

A robust adaptive controller is proposed with the utilization of fuzzy logic and backstepping techniques. The unit quaternion is employed to describe the attitude of spacecraft for global representation without singularities. The system uncertainty is estimated by introducing a fuzzy logic system. The adaptive mechanism has only two parameters to be adapted on-line because the adaptive law of the proposed controller is derived from the norm of the weight matrix. The stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by Lyapunov direct approach. Results of numerical simulations state that the proposed controller is successful in achieving high attitude performance in the presence of parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, actuator failures, and control input constraints. },

One of the main features of the proposed scheme is that the control reconfiguration is achieved automatically based only on the response of the overall system. The method is developed for the case when one or more actuators freeze in a certain position and do not respond to subsequent commands. We assumed that the information about the failure is not available to the controller. To solve this problem, a control law with adjustable parameters is introduced, and, using a convenient parametrization of the overall system, the resulting error model is expressed in a somewhat modified form as compared to those arising in standard adaptive control. The design of the corresponding adaptive laws based on Lyapunov analysis allow us to prove global stability of the overall scheme in the presence of multiple actuator failures},

The control of this class of complex systems is difficult to handle by the traditional controller designs around their operating points. This paper, however, explores the concepts of controller-driven model and virtual unmodeled dynamics to propose a new design framework. The design consists of two controllers with distinct functions. First, using input and output data, a self-tuning controller is constructed based on a linear controller-driven model. Then the output signals of the controller-driven model are compared with the true outputs of the system to produce so-called virtual unmodeled dynamics. Based on the compensator of the virtual unmodeled dynamics, the second controller based on a nonlinear controller-driven model is proposed. Those two controllers are integrated by an adaptive switching control algorithm to take advantage of their complementary features: one offers stabilization function and another provides improved performance. The conditions on the stability and convergence of the closed-loop system are analyzed. Both simulation and experimental tests on a heavily coupled nonlinear twin-tank system are carried out to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {There are two objectives to this paper. First, a chattering-free sliding-mode controller is proposed for the trajectory control of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Second, a new approach for thrust allocation is proposed that is based on minimizing the largest individual component of the thrust manifold. With regards to the former, a new adaptive term is developed that eliminates the high-frequency control action inherent in a conventional sliding-mode controller. As opposed to the common adaptive approach, the new adaptive term does not require the linearity condition on the dynamic parameters and the creation of a regressor matrix. In addition, it removes the need for a priori knowledge of upper bounds on uncertainties in the dynamic parameters of the ROV. With regards to the latter, it is demonstrated that minimizing the l∞ norm (infinity-norm) of the thrust manifold ensures low individual thruster forces. The new control and thrust allocation concepts are implemented in numerical simulations of a work class ROV, and the chattering-free nature of the controller is demonstrated during typical \{ROV\} manoeuvres. In the simulation studies, the l∞ norm-based thrust allocation problem is cast as a linear programming problem that allows direct incorporation of the thruster saturation limits and a fault-tolerant property. To achieve real-time solution rates for the l∞ norm-based thrust allocation problem, a recurrent neural network is designed. In the simulation studies, the l∞ norm-based thrust allocation provides smaller maximum absolute value of the largest component of the thrust manifold than that of a conventional l2 norm (2-norm) minimization, satisfies the saturation limits of each thruster, and accommodates faults that are introduced arbitrarily during the manoeuvre. },

Then we propose a new controller design scheme based on a prescribed performance bound (PPB) which characterizes the convergence rate and maximum overshoot of the tracking error. It is shown that the tracking error satisfies the prescribed performance bound all the time.

Based on available process measurements, the locally weighted projection regression is used in the offline learning scheme to provide a series of locally weighted linear models, in which the algorithms of traditional projection to latent structures (PLS) and total PLS could be applied to establish improved test statistics suitable for complicated process monitoring. By using the weights of local models obtained from measurement learning, the developed test statistics are further online utilized to monitor potential abnormalities related or unrelated to process quality. The effectiveness of the proposed locally weighted total PLS monitoring approach is finally demonstrated by the comparisons with other relevant methods via simulations based on the wastewater treatment process benchmark under different abnormal conditions.},

With the application of the precise estimation value, a nonlinear tracking controller is then proposed with disturbance compensated. It is shown by the Lyapunov stability analysis that the entire controller-observer system is asymptotically stable. The key feature of the scheme is that it not only has the superior capability to attenuate unknown external disturbance torque and external force generated by the wind, but also able to achieve full control (i.e., six-degree-of-freedom) of quadrotor UAVs with position and attitude successfully controlled. The effectiveness of the approach is verified on a quadrotor UAV example.},

However, due to the particle impoverishment problem of the GPF, the estimation of hidden state in process may get misleading results and thus lead to undesired conclusion for fault detection purpose. To solve this problem, a fault detection strategy, which employs a novel kind of particle filter, i.e. intelligent particle filter (IPF), is proposed in this paper. The proposed IPF strategy could improve the impoverishment problem of GPF and increase the accuracy of hidden state estimation, thus offers desired results for fault detection.

When resources are limited, especially for networked systems sharing data and communication power and bandwidth, identification must consider complexity as a critical limitation. Focusing on optimal resource allocation under a given reliability requirement, this paper studies identification complexity and its relations to decision making. Dynamic resource assignments are investigated. Algorithms are developed and their convergence properties are established, including strong convergence, almost sure convergence rate, and asymptotic normality. By a suitable design of resource updating step sizes, the algorithms are shown to achieve the CR lower bound asymptotically, and hence are asymptotically efficient.

An important component in modern wind turbines is the converter, which for a wind turbine control point–of–view normally provides the torque acting on the wind turbine generator, as well as measurement of this torque. In this work, a diagnosis strategy based on fuzzy prototypes is presented, in order to detect these faults in the converter, and isolate them either to be an actuator or a sensor fault. The fuzzy system is used since the model under investigation is nonlinear, whilst the wind speed measurement is highly noisy, due to the turbulence around the rotor plane. The fuzzy system consists of a set of piecewise affine Takagi–Sugeno models, which are identified from the noisy measurements acquired from the simulated wind turbine. The fault detection and isolation strategy is thus designed based on these fuzzy models. The wind turbine simulator is finally used to validate the achieved performances of the suggested fault detection and isolation scheme.},

An H∞ non-fragile observer subjected to the transition rates of the switching mode is firstly constructed. By some specified matrices, the connections among the designed sliding surfaces corresponding to every mode are established. Then, the state-estimation-based sliding mode control law is designed to guarantee the reachability of the sliding surface in finite time interval. Furthermore, a stochastic stability criterion is established for all admissible uncertainties, which can guarantee the error system and sliding mode dynamics to be asymptotically stochastic stable with a given disturbance attenuation level.

The backstepping technique augmented by a robust adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and an auxiliary design system is employed as the main control framework. Based on the dynamic model of the MSV, an improved adaptive integral line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law is first proposed, which is suitable for any parametric paths and can deal with time-varying ocean currents. The guidance law calculates the desired yaw angle and estimates the currents. Then the controller is extended to cope with the \{MSV\} yaw tracking and velocity control by resorting to the augmented backstepping technique. The uncertainties of dynamics are compensated by the robust RBFNNs. Each robust \{RBFNN\} utilizes an nth-order smooth switching function to combine a conventional \{RBFNN\} with a robust control. The auxiliary design system is presented to analyze the effect of input saturation, and states of the auxiliary design system are used to develop the controller. This systematic design methodology is proved to achieve ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop \{MSV\} system. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach. },

  abstract = {Abstract Prognostics are a key activity in repair and maintenance operations. A recent approach to condition-based maintenance is the data-driven approach. This approach has been mostly based on past failure time measures, and sensed measurements of component degradation to derive estimates of the remaining useful life of equipment. An alternative source of data, rarely used in these models, is the stream of automatic messages derived from diagnostics systems, which consist of fault codes indicating abnormal events or deviations from optimal operation. Despite the richness and concise nature of these messages, their difficult interpretation poses significant challenges to its use in prognostics. This paper aims to show that data-driven prognostics based on this type of messages can be better suited to maintenance than time-based approaches. We illustrate this comparison with an industrial case study involving the removal times of a bleed valve from the aircraft air management system. Our experimental results reveal a significant accuracy improvement over the contrasting time-based models. We also establish the contribution to this improvement of the data-driven methods and message-related predictors. },

  abstract = {Random noise in seismic data can affect the performance of reservoir characterization and interpretation, which makes denoising become an essential procedure. This letter focuses on suppressing random noise in poststack seismic data while preserving the edges of desired signals. Due to the lateral continuity of seismic data, polynomial fitting (PF) method can be a good alternative in attenuating random noise. However, discontinuities exist widely in poststack seismic data, which might be damaged by the PF filter. By contrast, principle component analysis (PCA)-based filters have better performance in edge preserving, but there appear artifacts in the denoised results using the PCA-based filters. Thus, we propose an edge-preserving polynomial PCA filter which combines advantages of the PF and PCA methods by optimizing a PCA problem with a weighted polynomial constraint. The weight coefficient is determined adaptively according to the signal-to-noise ratio estimation and the energy proportion in the selected analysis window, which can help distinguish the horizontal continuous events and the edges effectively. To deal with the complicated slopes which make the local linear hypothesis invalid, we introduce a robust local slope estimation method and apply the slope estimation-based event tracing strategy to horizontally align the data set. Synthetic and field data examples show that the proposed method has a better performance in noise attenuation and edge preserving, compared with the edge-preserving PF method. In addition, the denoised results are free from artifacts.},

This paper proposes a novel IC solder joint inspection method based on the idea of robust principle component analysis (RPCA), which is a celebrated optimization technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time IC solder joint inspection is formulated as an optimization problem. In particular, we model an IC solder joint image as observed data corrupted by gross errors. According to the RPCA theory, the observed data can be approximately decomposed into a low-rank component and an error component. In this paper, an appearance model of qualified IC solder joints is defined for IC solder joint inspection based on RPCA. Then, a defect score is defined based on the appearance model and is used to evaluate the quality of IC solder joints. Meanwhile, location prior knowledge related to human perception is incorporated in the defect score to further evaluate the defects of IC solder joints. Finally, a simple discrimination scheme is proposed to inspect IC solder joints. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the existing methods in inspection performance.},

Since many sensors are used as input variables to estimate the output, the probability that one of the sensors fails increases significantly. In this paper, we propose a self-validating inferential sensor approach based on principal component analysis (PCA). The input sensors are validated using a fault identification and reconstruction approach proposed in Dunia et al. AIChE J. 1996, 42, 2797−2812. A principal component model is built for the input sensors for sensor validation, and the validated principal components are used to predict output variables using linear regression or neural networks. If a sensor fails, the sensor is identified and reconstructed with the best estimate from its correlation to other sensors. The principal components are also reconstructed accordingly for prediction. The number of principal components used in sensor validation and prediction are chosen differently based on different criteria. The typical input correlation or collinearity is utilized for sensor validation and removed in predicting the output to avoid ill-conditioning. The self-validating soft sensor approach is applied to air emission monitoring, where continuous monitoring of the air pollutants is required for environmental regulations. },

  abstract = {Chemical process plant safety, production specifications, environmental regulations, operational constraints, and plant economics are some of the main reasons driving an upward interest in research and development of more robust methods for process monitoring and control. Principal component analysis (PCA) has long been used in fault detection by extracting relevant information from multivariate chemical data. The recent success of wavelets and multi-scale methods in chemical process monitoring and control has catalyzed an interest in the investigation of wavelets based methods for fault detection. In the present work, multi-scale principal component analysis (MSPCA) is used for fault detection and diagnosis. \{MSPCA\} simultaneously extracts both, cross correlation across the sensors (PCA approach) and auto-correlation within a sensor (wavelet approach). Using wavelets, the individual sensor signals are decomposed into approximations and details at different scales. Contributions from each scale are collected in separate matrices, and a \{PCA\} model is then constructed to extract correlation at each scale. The multi-scale nature of \{MSPCA\} formulation makes it suitable to work with process data that are typically non-stationary and represent the cumulative effect of many underlying process phenomena, each operating at a different scale. The proposed \{MSPCA\} approach is able to outperform the conventional \{PCA\} based approach in detecting and identifying real process faults in an industrial process, and yields minimum false alarms. Additionally, the advantage of MSPCA, over the traditional \{PCA\} approach for sensor validation, is also demonstrated on an industrial boiler data set. },

The first method is the parity space approach, analyzed in a stochastic setting. This leads to Kalman filter like residual generators, but with a FIR filter rather than an IIR filter as for the Kalman filter. The second method is to use principal component analysis (PCA). The advantage is that no model or structural information about the dynamic system is needed, in contrast to the parity space approach. We explain how PCA works in terms of parity space relations. The methods are illustrated on a simulation model of an F-16 aircraft, where six different faults are considered. The result is that PCA has similar fault detection and isolation capabilities as the stochastic parity space approach.},

In this study, a two-step principal component analysis (TS-PCA) is proposed to handle the dynamic characteristics of chemical industrial processes in both steady state and unsteady state. Differently from the traditional dynamic PCA (DPCA) dealing with the static cross-correlation structure and dynamic auto-correlation structure in process data simultaneously, TS-PCA handles them in two steps: it first identifies the dynamic structure by using the least squares algorithm, and then monitors the innovation component by using PCA. The innovation component is time uncorrelated and independent of the initial state of the process. As a result, TS-PCA can monitor the process in both steady state and unsteady state, whereas all other reported dynamic approaches are limited to only processes in steady state. Even tested in steady state, TS-PCA still can achieve better performance than the existing dynamic approaches.

As it is difficult to build accurate physical model for UAV flight control systems, data driven models such as principal component analysis (PCA) have been applied in FDI of UAV. However, PCA based methods cannot take dynamic relations of inputs and outputs into consideration. In this paper, a dynamic PCA model combined with moving average technique is proposed for FDI in UAV, which is more suitable for dynamic systems. Furthermore, contribution analysis is firstly utilized to implement fault isolation of UAV. The case study on a simulated fixed-wing UAV control system under steady flight demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

PCA has been used by several authors to develop techniques to monitor chemical processes and detect the presence of disturbances [1–5]. In past work, we have developed methods which not only detect disturbances, but isolate the sources of the disturbances [4]. The approach was based on static PCA models, T2 and Q charts [6], and a model bank of possible disturbances. In this paper we use a well-known ‘time lag shift’ method to include dynamic behavior in the PCA model. The proposed dynamic PCA model development procedure is desirable due to its simplicity of construction, and is not meant to replace the many well-known and more elegant procedures used in model identification. While dynamic linear model identification, and time lag shift are well known methods in model building, this is the first application we are aware of in the area of statistical process monitoring. Extensive testing on the Tennessee Eastman process simulation [7] demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

Since the worst case complexity of the optimization problem increases exponentially with respect to the number of integer variables, an on-line implementation of the MPC for problems with large number of sub-systems and/or large horizons is usually expensive. In this technical note, we propose a stabilizing MPC formulation for state-dependent switched systems, that enables a tradeoff between the computational complexity of the MPC controller and the optimal performance of the closed-loop system. The proposed approach uses a pre-terminal set, in addition to the positively invariant terminal set, which aids in reducing the on-line complexity although at the expense of optimality. Examples are presented to illustrate the computational benefits of the proposed MPC strategy over existing MPC for switched systems.},

The beacon positions are unknown, but the agent can continuously measure its distances to them as well as its own position. This problem has two particular applications: (1) capturing a target signal source whose distances to the beacons are measured by these beacons and broadcasted to a surveillance agent, (2) merging a single agent to an autonomous multi-agent system so that the new agent is positioned at desired distances from the existing agents. The problem is solved using an adaptive control framework integrating a parameter estimator producing beacon location estimates, and an adaptive motion control law fed by these estimates to steer the agent toward the target. For location estimation, a least-squares adaptive law is used. The motion control law aims to minimize a convex cost function with unique minimizer at the target location, and is further augmented for persistence of excitation. Stability and convergence analysis is provided, as well as simulation results demonstrating performance and transient behavior.},

The behavior of the extremum seeking system is analyzed via an approximating system—the modified Lie bracket system. The modified Lie bracket system is essentially an online integral-type iterative learning control law. The paper contributes to two fields, namely, iterative learning control and extremum seeking. First, an online integral type iterative learning control with a forgetting factor is proposed. Its convergence is analyzed via $k$-dependent (iteration-dependent) contraction mapping in a Banach space equipped with so called $\lambda$-norm. Second, the iterative learning extremum seeking system can be interpreted as an iterative learning control with the approximation error as “disturbance”. The tracking error of its modified Lie bracket system can be shown uniformly bounded in terms of iterations by selecting a sufficiently large dither frequency. Furthermore, it is shown that the tracking error will eventually converge to a set. The center of the set corresponds to the limit solution of the “disturbance-free” system, and its radius can be controlled by the frequency.},

After reinterpreting some previous results for left-invariant problems on Lie groups, we focus on optimal control problems with subgroup symmetry. For these problems, the necessary conditions for optimality can be simplified by exploiting symmetries so as to reduce the number of variables needed to describe trajectories of the system. We show that sufficient conditions for optimality, based on the non-existence of conjugate points, can be simplified in an analogous way to the necessary conditions. We demonstrate these simplifications by analyzing an optimal control problem that models a spinning top in a gravitational field, and we give particular attention to the example of an axisymmetric sleeping top. The results we derive in this paper allow us to determine which trajectories of a sleeping top are locally optimal solutions of the optimal control problem, which is a new result that has not appeared in previous literature.},

The specific information including bounds of actuator faults, bounds of the nonlinear term and the external disturbance is not available for the controller design. The main attention focuses on designing the adaptive sliding-mode controller to overcome these problems. Firstly, a sliding-mode surface is constructed such that the reduced-order equivalent sliding motion is stochastically stable. Secondly, the adaptive sliding-mode controller can drive the state trajectories of the system onto the sliding-mode surface in finite time, and can estimate the loss of effectiveness of actuator faults and bounds of the nonlinear term and the external disturbance online. Thirdly, the stochastic stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed. Finally, a practical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented results.},

In attempt to complete the various missions, the near space airship first requires an accurate control system for autonomous flight. This paper presents an improved sliding mode control method for autonomous flight, considering the characteristics of nonlinearity, strong coupling and uncertainty of an airship. Firstly, the dimensional motion mathematical model of an airship is derived, including kinematics and dynamics equations. Then the controller for autonomous flight is designed by use of an improved variable structure control method, which adopts the boundary layer sliding mode control approach. Finally simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

A sliding mode controller (SMC) based on fuzzy approximation is proposed that steers an airship to remain fixed over a desired position. First, the dynamic model of an airship is derived and formulated. Second, a SMC is designed to actualize positioning control under the assumption that the airship model is accurately known. However, the airship model is partially or totally unknown in practice. In order to solve this problem, a fuzzy logic system is used to approximate the unknown model of the airship, and an adaptive law is adopted to update the optimal parameters. The stability and convergence of the closed-loop controller is proven by using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller are demonstrated via simulation results. Contrasting simulation results indicate that the proposed controller promotes the control precise and has better performance against the SMC. },

  abstract = {The capture of a free-floating tumbling object using an autonomous vehicle is a key technology for many future orbital missions. Spacecraft proximity operations will play an important role in guaranteeing the success of such missions. In this paper, we technically propose a tracking control scheme for proximity operations between a target and a pursuer spacecraft that ensures accurate relative position tracking as well as attitude synchronization. Specifically, an integrated six degrees of freedom dynamics model is first established to describe the relative motion of the pursuer with respect to the target. Then, a robust fault-tolerant controller is derived by combining the sliding mode control and the adaptive technique. The designed controller is proved to be not only robust against unexpected disturbances and adaptive to unknown and uncertain mass/inertia properties of the pursuer, but also able to accommodate a large class of actuator faults. In particular, by incorporating a novel time-varying forcing function into the sliding dynamics, the proposed control algorithm is able to guarantee the finite-time convergence of the translational and rotational tracking errors, and the convergence time as an explicit parameter can be assigned a priori by the designers. Furthermore, a theoretical analysis is also presented to assess the fault tolerance ability of the designed controller. Finally, numerous examples are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and demonstrate the benefits of the overall control approach.},

In the past, numerous PCA-based statistical process monitoring methods have been developed and applied to various chemical processes. However, these previous methods assume that the monitored process is linear, whereas most of the chemical reactions in chemical processes are nonlinear. For such nonlinear systems, PCA-based monitoring has proved inefficient and problematic, prompting the development of several nonlinear PCA methods. In this paper, we propose a new nonlinear PCA-based method that uses kernel functions, and we compare the proposed method with previous methods. A unified fault detection index is developed based on the energy approximation concept. In particular, a new approach to fault identification, which is a challenging problem in nonlinear PCA, is formulated based on a robust reconstruction error calculation. The proposed monitoring method was applied to two simple nonlinear processes and the simulated continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) process. The monitoring results confirm that the proposed methodology affords credible fault detection and identification.},

We present formal methods for inferring (via supervised learning) and detecting (via unsupervised learning) anomalous behavior. Our procedures use data to construct a signal temporal logic (STL) formula that describes normal system behavior. This logic can be used to formulate properties such as “If the train brakes within 500 m of the platform at a speed of 50 km/hr, then it will stop in at least 30 s and at most 50 s.” Our procedure infers not only the physical parameters involved in the formula (e.g., 500 m in the example above) but also its logical structure. STL gives a more human-readable representation of behavior than classifiers represented as surfaces in high-dimensional feature spaces. The learned formula enables us to perform early detection by using monitoring techniques and anomaly mitigation by using formal synthesis techniques. We demonstrate the power of our methods with examples of naval surveillance and a train braking system.},

However, there is renewed interest in improving system performance to deal with growing energy constraints. This paper describes a learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) scheme that provides deterministic guarantees on robustness, while statistical identification tools are used to identify richer models of the system in order to improve performance; the benefits of this framework are that it handles state and input constraints, optimizes system performance with respect to a cost function, and can be designed to use a wide variety of parametric or nonparametric statistical tools. The main insight of LBMPC is that safety and performance can be decoupled under reasonable conditions in an optimization framework by maintaining two models of the system. The first is an approximate model with bounds on its uncertainty, and the second model is updated by statistical methods. LBMPC improves performance by choosing inputs that minimize a cost subject to the learned dynamics, and it ensures safety and robustness by checking whether these same inputs keep the approximate model stable when it is subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that if the system is sufficiently excited, then the LBMPC control action probabilistically converges to that of an MPC computed using the true dynamics.},

Recent approaches successfully introduce safety based on reachability analysis, determining a safe region of the state space where the system can operate. However, overly constraining the freedom of the system can negatively affect performance, while attempting to learn less conservative safety constraints might fail to preserve safety if the learned constraints are inaccurate. We propose a novel method that uses a principled approach to learn the system's unknown dynamics based on a Gaussian process model and iteratively approximates the maximal safe set. A modified control strategy based on real-time model validation preserves safety under weaker conditions than current approaches. Our framework further incorporates safety into the reinforcement learning performance metric, allowing a better integration of safety and learning. We demonstrate our algorithm on simulations of a cart-pole system and on an experimental quadrotor application and show how our proposed scheme succeeds in preserving safety where current approaches fail to avoid an unsafe condition.},

By pairing machine learning algorithms with rigorous safety analyses, such as Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) reachability, this limitation can be overcome. Guaranteed Safe Online Learning via Reachability (GSOLR) is a framework which combines HJI reachability with general machine learning techniques, allowing for the design of robotic systems which demonstrate both high performance and guaranteed safety. In this paper we show how the GSOLR framework can be applied to a target tracking problem, in which an observing quadrotor helicopter must keep a target ground vehicle with unknown (but bounded) dynamics inside its field of view at all times, while simultaneously attempting to build a motion model of the target. The resulting algorithm was implemented on board the Stanford Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi-Agent Control, and was compared to a naive safety-only algorithm and a learning-only algorithm. Experimental results illustrate the success of the GSOLR algorithm, even under scenarios in which the machine learning algorithm performed poorly (and would otherwise lead to unsafe actions), thus demonstrating the power of this technique.},

  abstract  = {We present a mathematical programming-based method for optimal control of nonlinear systems subject to temporal logic task specifications. We specify tasks using a fragment of linear temporal logic (LTL) that allows both finite- and infinite-horizon properties to be specified, including tasks such as surveillance, periodic motion, repeated assembly, and environmental monitoring. Our method directly encodes an LTL formula as mixed-integer linear constraints on the system variables, avoiding the computationally expensive process of creating a finite abstraction. Our approach is efficient; for common tasks our formulation uses significantly fewer binary variables than related approaches and gives the tightest possible convex relaxation. We apply our method on piecewise affine systems and certain classes of differentially flat systems. In numerical experiments, we solve temporal logic motion planning tasks for high-dimensional (10                                                                          {\$}{\$}+{\$}{\$}                                                            +                                                       continuous state) systems.},

We assume that a cost function is defined over the configuration space. Examples of a cost function include hazard levels, wireless connectivity, and energy consumption, to name a few. The proposed method consists of two parts: sampling-based cost-aware path planning considering the vehicle dynamics based on rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT*), and a high-level logic which determines how to extend the RRT tree based on spatiotemporal specifications of an LTL formula. In order to find a low-cost trajectory with computational efficiency, the proposed method expands the RRT tree with long extensions using cross entropy, while the rewiring step of RRT* is used to preserve the asymptotic optimality. In simulation and experiments, we show that the proposed method performs favorably compared to existing methods.},

Automata-based verification allows the decomposition the verification task into a finite collection of simpler constraints over the continuous state space.

These results imply that the local frequency deviations on each bus convey exactly the right information about the global power imbalance for the loads to make individual decisions that turn out to be globally optimal.

The synthesized protocols are robust against exogenous disturbances on the continuous dynamics and can react to possibly adversarial events (both external and internal). Finite-state approximations that abstract the behavior of the underlying continuous dynamics are defined using finite transition systems. Such approximations allow us to transform the continuous switching synthesis problem into a discrete synthesis problem in the form of a two-player game between the system and the environment, where the winning conditions represent the high-level temporal logic specifications. Restricting to an expressive subclass of LTL formulas, these temporal logic games are amenable to solutions with polynomial-time complexity. By construction, existence of a discrete switching strategy for the discrete synthesis problem guarantees the existence of a switching protocol that can be implemented at the continuous level to ensure the correctness of the nonlinear switched system and to react to the environment at run time.},

To alleviate the associated computational complexity of LTL synthesis, we propose a receding horizon framework that effectively reduces the synthesis problem into a set of smaller problems. The proposed control structure consists of a goal generator, a trajectory planner, and a continuous controller. The goal generator reduces the trajectory generation problem into a sequence of smaller problems of short horizon while preserving the desired system-level temporal properties. Subsequently, in each iteration, the trajectory planner solves the corresponding short-horizon problem with the currently observed state as the initial state and generates a feasible trajectory to be implemented by the continuous controller. Based on the simulation property, we show that the composition of the goal generator, trajectory planner and continuous controller and the corresponding receding horizon framework guarantee the correctness of the system with respect to its specification regardless of the environment in which the system operates. In addition, we present a response mechanism to handle failures that may occur due to a mismatch between the actual system and its model. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated through an example of an autonomous vehicle navigating an urban environment. This example also illustrates that the system is not only robust with respect to exogenous disturbances but is also capable of properly handling violation of the environment assumption that is explicitly stated as part of the system specification.},

Due to these pragmatic constraints, integration is just as important as theoretical and applied work in developing the actual deliberative functionalities. In this article, we present a temporal logic-based task planning and execution monitoring framework and its integration into a fully deployed rotor-based unmanned aircraft system developed in our laboratory. We use a very challenging emergency services application involving body identification and supply delivery as a vehicle for showing the potential use of such a framework in real-world applications. TALplanner, a temporal logic-based task planner, is used to generate mission plans. Building further on the use of TAL (Temporal Action Logic), we show how knowledge gathered from the appropriate sensors during plan execution can be used to create state structures, incrementally building a partial logical model representing the actual development of the system and its environment over time. We then show how formulas in the same logic can be used to specify the desired behavior of the system and its environment and how violations of such formulas can be detected in a timely manner in an execution monitor subsystem. The pervasive use of logic throughout the higher level deliberative layers of the system architecture provides a solid shared declarative semantics that facilitates the transfer of knowledge between different modules.},

Therefore, there always exist differences between the dynamical model and real system, and uncertainties during the flight, thus, leading significant degradation of control performance. To solve the performance degradation problem, this paper proposes neural networks-based adaptive velocity and altitude tracking controllers. In order for that, the hypersonic aircraft model is transformed into an uncertain feedback system, which has both matched and unmatched uncertainties, by differentiating the velocity and altitude with respect to time. Then, the overall tracking control system is designed systematically by introducing virtual control inputs and dynamic surface control. During the design process, an inverse of an input gain matrix is directly trained and adapted to remove the matched uncertainty and controller singularity problem simultaneously. In addition, several adaptive elements with saturation functions are added to handle all the matched and unmatched uncertainties. The proposed controller guarantees the uniformly ultimate boundedness of the tracking error by utilizing deadzoned errors. Finally, numerical simulations with the uncertain hypersonic aircraft are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

For actuator faults, a controller is designed around a state-feedback sliding-mode scheme where the gain of the nonlinear unit vector term is allowed to adaptively increase at the onset of a fault. Unexpected deviation of the switching variables from their nominal condition triggers the adaptation mechanism. The controller proposed here is relatively simple and yet is shown to work across the entire "up and away" flight envelope. For sensor faults, the application of a robust method for fault reconstruction using a sliding-mode observer is considered. The novelty lies in the application of the sensor fault reconstruction scheme to correct the corrupted measured signals before they are used by the controller, and therefore the controller does not need to be reconfigured.},

For the purpose of developing the detection scheme, only the phase angles of the generators are measured, which represent a subset of the differential states of the DAEs. The objective is to estimate the differential states (the phase angles and frequencies of the generators), the algebraic states (the phase angles of the load bus tensions) and to reconstruct a class of load altering faults affecting the network. The proposed observer is assessed in simulation on two IEEE benchmarks: the 9-bus and 14-bus networks, so as to verify its capability to correctly estimate the differential and algebraic states of the network in spite of its complexity and uncertainty. Moreover, the capability of the proposed scheme to detect the presence of a load altering fault, to exactly identify its position in the network, and to precisely reconstruct the shape of the fault itself is shown and discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new interacting multiple model (IMM) filter for actuator fault detection. Since each individual filter of the IMM filter uses the combined information of the estimation values from all the operating filters, it can effectively estimate system parameter variations, thereby it can diagnose the actuator damage with an unknown magnitude. In this study, to diagnose the actuator failure fast and accurately, fuzzy logic is used to tune a transition probability among multiple models. This makes the fault detection process smooth and reduces the possibility of false fault detection. Also, a discrete fault tolerant command tracker is derived to cope with actuator damages. To validate the performance of the proposed fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithm, numerical simulations are performed for a high performance aircraft system.},

We demonstrate that terminal sliders provide robustness to parametric uncertainty without having to resort to high frequency control switching, as in the case of conventional sliders [2]. In addition, stability analysis that is conducted to demonstrate terminal slider approach results in improved control performance and allows for simple robust design of control parameters. Further, improved (guaranteed) precision of terminal sliders is argued for through an analysis of steady state behavior.},

First, the authors present a model to identify the dynamics of the SbW system, in which the self-aligning torque and friction-related forces are treated as external disturbances. Second, the AFNTSM control design is elaborated, which is proved to be able to guarantee high tracking accuracy via effectively estimating the self-aligning torque, fast convergence rate owing to its exponential stability, strong robustness against system and road surface uncertainties, and inherently smooth control inputs. Subsequently, the selection criteria of the control parameters are given in details. Finally, experimental results are shown to demonstrate that the designed AFNTSM controller has great superiority in comparison with an FNTSM controller without adaptation and an adaptive sliding mode controller based on conventional sliding mode.},

  abstract = {Abstract Based on the principles of the Non-singular Terminal Sliding Mode Control (NTSMC), a new control law along with an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) has been proposed for robotic manipulators, that can tolerate external disturbances and noises with unknown statistics. First, a neural network module has been used as a discontinuous control part of the NTSMC to enhance the performance of the controller due to chattering phenomenon. Furthermore, a new methodology is proposed which is based on a modified evolutionary algorithm (charged systems search) to estimate the system states by the UKF and the measurement and process noise covariances. To compare this evolutionary method with classical methods, an optimal Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithm has been introduced that estimates the noise statistics recursively within the algorithm. The proposed control method and observer have been simulated on a 6-DOF robot manipulator.},

  abstract = { In this article, the problem of robust fault-tolerant tracking control is investigated for the longitudinal model of airbreathing hypersonic vehicle in the presence of actuator faults and external disturbances. First, a fault-tolerant control strategy based on finite time integral sliding mode is presented for the longitudinal model of airbreathing hypersonic vehicle, which guarantees that velocity and altitude track their reference signals in finite time. However, this method needs to know the minimum value of actuator efficiency factor and the upper bound of external disturbances. Then, an improved adaptive fault-tolerant control scheme is developed, where two adaptive laws are used to estimate the upper bound of external disturbances and the minimum value of actuator efficiency factor. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed control strategy is effective in rejecting external disturbances and handling actuator faults. },

  abstract  = {This paper discusses the design of a combined backstepping/Lyapunov controller for the attitude, velocity and height control of an unmanned, unstable, fin-less airship. As the airship actuation has more degrees of freedom than the motion controlled, the controller includes a quadratic optimization algorithm to find the optimal thruster commands. The control law developed provides attitude and velocity control for the entire airship flight regime, i.e., hover, vertical ascent and descent as well as cruise, all with a single controller. Controller performance is first verified using a simulation that includes detailed modeling of sensor noise, computational delays and actuation dynamics. Subsequently, the controller is tested in outdoor flight tests. The controller has been found to perform well both in simulation and flight tests. The controller parameters were identical in simulation and flight test demonstrating the high fidelity of the simulation.},

  abstract = { Purpose – The purpose of the paper is to present an approach to detect and isolate the aircraft sensor and control surface/actuator failures affecting the mean of the Kalman filter innovation sequence.Design/methodology/approach – The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is developed for nonlinear flight dynamic estimation of an F‐16 fighter and the effects of the sensor and control surface/actuator failures in the innovation sequence of the designed EKF are investigated. A robust Kalman filter (RKF) is very useful to isolate the control surface/actuator failures and sensor failures. The technique for control surface detection and identification is applied to an unstable multi‐input multi‐output model of a nonlinear AFTI/F‐16 fighter. The fighter is stabilized by means of a linear quadratic optimal controller. The control gain brings all the eigenvalues that are outside the unit circle, inside the unit circle. It also keeps the mechanical limits on the deflections of control surfaces. The fighter has nine state variables and six control inputs.Findings – In the simulations, the longitudinal and lateral dynamics of an F‐16 aircraft dynamic model are considered, and the sensor and control surface/actuator failures are detected and isolated.Research limitations/implications – A real‐time detection of sensor and control surface/actuator failures affecting the mean of the innovation process applied to the linearized F‐16 fighter flight dynamic is examined and an effective approach to isolate the sensor and control surface/actuator failures is proposed. The nonlinear F‐16 model is linearized. Failures affecting the covariance of the innovation sequence is not considered in the paper.Originality/value – An approach has been proposed to detect and isolate the aircraft sensor and control surface/actuator failures occurred in the aircraft control system. An extended Kalman filter has been developed for the nonlinear flight dynamic estimation of an F‐16 fighter. Failures in the sensors and control surfaces/actuators affect the characteristics of the innovation sequence of the EKF. The failures that affect the mean of the innovation sequence have been considered. When the EKF is used, the decision statistics changes regardless the fault is in the sensors or in the control surfaces/actuators, while a RKF is used, it is easy to distinguish the sensor and control surface/actuator faults. },

Then, a sliding mode based nonlinear discrete observer is proposed such that the sliding motion of the error dynamical system is asymptotically stable on a designed surface. Then the FE can be achieved through this observer. Finally, an example is included to show the efficiency of the proposed method.},

The proposed systems are more general, which relax the traditional assumption in Markov jump systems that all the transition probabilities must be completely known. A residual generator is constructed and the corresponding FD is formulated as an H ∞ filtering problem by which the error between residual and fault are minimised in the H ∞ sense. The linear matrix inequality-based sufficient conditions for the existence of FD filter are derived. A numerical example on a multiplier–accelerator model economic system is given to illustrate the potential of the developed theoretical results. },

It is argued that if only relative position information between the leader and follower spacecraft is available, the problem of reconstructing an actuator fault signal, modelled as an additive unknown input to the system, represents one of estimating the unknown inputs in a relative degree two type system. This means many of the existing unknown input observer schemes are not applicable. Here both a broken super-twisting scheme and a 3rd order sliding mode observer are considered. The results of using these schemes on a 'real world' simulation are compared.},

A Lyapunov based analysis for the adaptive super-twisting scheme is presented to demonstrate its properties. As an example, the adaptive differentiator proposed in this paper has been used as part of a nonlinear FDI scheme for an Oscillatory Failure Case (OFC) in an actuator. The FDI scheme requires an estimate of the rod speed which is provided by the adaptive super-twisting differentiator. Due to the conditions in which the actuator operates, normally the differentiator gains are initialised at low values to ensure good rod speed estimation in fault free conditions. However for large amplitude/frequency OFCs, the gains must adapt in order to maintain sliding and provide a good estimation. Simulations on a high fidelity nonlinear aircraft benchmark model have been carried out for both liquid and solid OFCs.},
